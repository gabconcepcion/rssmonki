/><h2>Core Concepts</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> Ember.js is not a framework for building traditional websites.</p></blockquote><p>The first thing to keep in mind is that Ember.js is not a framework for building traditional websites. Libraries like jQuery and MooTools are a great fit for that. If you&#8217;re considering Ember.js, then the assumption is that you&#8217;re looking to build desktop-like experiences &#8211; especially scalable ones. In fact, the slogan for the framework is &quot;a framework for developing ambitious web applications&quot; which tells you it&#8217;s clearly not your daddy&#8217;s JavaScript library.</p><p>I mentioned previously that Ember leverages the MVC pattern for promoting proper code management and organization. If you&#8217;ve never done MVC-based development, you should definitely read up on it. Nettuts+ has a <a
href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/mvc-for-noobs/?search_index=10">great article on the topic here</a>. For those of you familiar with the concepts, you should feel at home. The one thing I&#8217;ve heard consistently is that making the shift from Backbone to Ember.js is actually easy because Ember does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, while still maintaining the code organization patterns that those developers are accustomed to.</p><p>Ember also relies on client-side templates&#8230; a <strong>LOT</strong>. It uses the <a
href="http://www.handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars templating library</a> which provides expressions that allow you to create dynamic HTML-based templates. An Ember developer can bind data to these embeddable expressions and dynamically change the display of their app on the fly. For example, I can create a template that can receive an array of people and display them in an unordered list:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
&lt;ul&gt;
 {{#each people}}
   &lt;li&gt;Hello, {{name}}!&lt;/li&gt;
 {{/each}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre><p>Notice the &#8220;#each&#8221; expression that works as a loop directive, enumerating over each element of the &#8220;people&#8221; array and replacing the &#8220;{{name}}&#8221; expression with an actual value. It&#8217;s important to note that the double brackets are tokens used by Handlebars to identify expressions. This is a small example, and we&#8217;ll dive into more detail later.</p><p>Handlebars is an incredibly powerful client-side templating engine and I would recommend reviewing not only <a
href="http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/handlebars-basics/">the Ember guides</a>, but the <a
href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars website itself</a> to get a full grasp of the options available. You&#8217;ll be using it quite a bit.</p><hr
/><h2>Setting up Ember</h2><p>Ember.js relies on additional libraries, so you&#8217;ll need to go grab a copy of <a
href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and <a
href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>. But, wait, didn&#8217;t I say that jQuery and Ember play in different spaces? Well, yeah I did, but here&#8217;s the thing: the Ember team is all about not reinventing the wheel. They chose jQuery to do what it does best: work with the DOM. And that&#8217;s a good thing, since jQuery is really good at that. It&#8217;s also why they went with Handlebars, which is an excellent templating library that happened to be written by Yehuda Katz, who is an Ember core team member.</p><p>The easiest way to get the files you need is to go to the Ember.js Github repo and pull down the <a
href="https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit">Starter Kit</a>. It&#8217;s a boilerplate for you to start off with. At the time of this writing, it contains:</p><ul><li>Ember 1.0 RC1</li><li>Handlerbars 1.0 RC3</li><li>jQuery 1.9.1</li></ul><p>There&#8217;s also a basic html template that is coded to include all of the associated libraries (jQuery, Ember, etc.) and along with an example of a Handlebars template and &#8220;app.js&#8221;, which includes code for kicking off a basic Ember app.</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
&lt;script src=&quot;js/libs/jquery-1.9.1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;js/libs/handlebars-1.0.0-rc.3.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;js/libs/ember-1.0.0-rc.1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;js/app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre><p>Just note that app.js isn&#8217;t part of the framework. It&#8217;s a plain ole JavaScript file; you can name it anything you want. And, while we&#8217;ll use it for the purposes of this tutorial series, down the road, you&#8217;ll likely end up splitting your JavaScript into multiple files just like you would for any other site or app. Also, Ember doesn&#8217;t expect a specific directory structure for your framework files.</p><p>When you look at the Starter Kit code, it may look like your typical website code. In some respects, you&#8217;re right! Once we start organizing things, though, you&#8217;ll see how building an Ember app is different.</p><hr
/><h2>The Lay of Ember Land</h2><p>Before you start hacking at code, it&#8217;s important to understand how Ember.js works and that you grok the moving parts that make up an Ember app. Let&#8217;s take a look at those parts and how they relate to each other.</p><hr
/><h2>Templates</h2><p>Templates are a key part of defining your user interface. As I mentioned previously, Handlebars is the client-side library used in Ember and the expressions provided by the library are used extensively when creating the UI for your application. Here&#8217;s a simple example:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/x-handlebars&quot;&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{{firstName}} {{lastName}}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre><p>Notice that the expressions are mixed into your HTML markup and, via Ember, will dynamically change the content displayed on the page. In this case, the {{firstName}} and {{lastName}} placeholders will be replaced by data retrieved from the app.</p><p>Handlebars offers a lot of power, via a flexible API. It will be important for you to understand what it offers.</p><hr
/><h2>Routing</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> An application&#8217;s Router helps to manage the state of the application.</p></blockquote><p>An application&#8217;s Router helps to manage the state of the application and the resources needed as a user navigates the app. This can include tasks such as requesting data from a model, hooking up controllers to views, or displaying templates.</p><p>You do this by creating a route for specific locations within your application. Routes specify parts of the application and the URLs associated to them. The URL is the key identifier that Ember uses to understand which application state needs to be presented to the user.</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
App.Router.map( function() {
   this.route( 'about' ); // Takes us to &quot;/about&quot;
});
</pre><p>The behaviors of a route (e.g.: requesting data from a model) are managed via instances of the Ember route object and are fired when a user navigates to a specific URL. An example would be requesting data from a model, like this:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
App.EmployeesRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
   model: function() {
       return App.Employee.find();
   }
});
</pre><p>In this case, when a user navigates to the &#8220;/employees&#8221; section of the application, the route makes a request to the model for a list of all employees.</p><hr
/><h2>Models</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> An object representation of the data.</p></blockquote><p>Models are an object representation of the data your application will use. It could be a simple array or data dynamically retrieved from a RESTful JSON API, via an Ajax request. The <a
href="https://github.com/emberjs/data">Ember Data</a> library offers the API for loading, mapping and updating data to models within your application.</p><hr
/><h2>Controllers</h2><p>Controllers are typically used to store and represent model data and attributes. They act like a proxy, giving you access to the model&#8217;s attributes and allowing templates to access them to dynamically render the display. This is why a template will always be connected to a controller.</p><p>The main thing to remember is that, while a model retrieves data, a controller is what you&#8217;ll use to programmatically expose that data to different parts of your application. While it may seem that models and controllers are tightly coupled, in fact, models, themselves, have no knowledge of the controllers that will use them later on.</p><p>You can also store other application properties that need to persist but don&#8217;t need to be saved to a server.</p><hr
/><h2>Views</h2><p>Views in Ember.js are meant to manage events around user interaction and translate them into events that have meaning within your application. So, if a user clicks on a button to delete an employee, the view is responsible for interpreting that native browser click event and processing it appropriately within the context your application&#8217;s current state.</p><hr
/><h2>Naming Conventions</h2><p>One of the ways that Ember.js helps to minimize the amount of code needed and handle things for you behind the scenes is through naming conventions. The way that you define and name your routes (and resources) impacts the naming of your controllers, models, views and templates. For example, if I create a route, called &#8220;employees&#8221;:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
App.Router.map( function() {
   this.resource( 'employees' );
});
</pre><p>I would then name my components, like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Route object:</strong> <em>App.EmployeesRoute</em></li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> <em>App.EmployeesController</em></li><li><strong>Model:</strong> <em>App.Employee</em></li><li><strong>View:</strong> <em>App.EmployeesView</em></li><li><strong>Template:</strong> <em>employees</em></li></ul><p>Using this naming convention serves a dual purpose. First, it gives you a semantic relationship between like components. Secondly, Ember can automatically create the necessary objects that may not exist (e.g.: a route object or a controller) and wire them up for use in your application. This is the &#8220;magic&#8221; that I mentioned earlier. In fact, this is specifically what Ember does at the global Application level, when you instantiate the Application object:</p><p>var App = Ember.Application.create();</p><p>That single line creates the default references to the application&#8217;s router, controller, view and template.</p><ul><li><strong>Route object:</strong> <em>App.ApplicationRoute</em></li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> <em>App.ApplicationController</em></li><li><strong>View:</strong> <em>App.ApplicationView</em></li><li><strong>Template:</strong> <em>application</em></li></ul><p>Going back to the &#8220;employees&#8221; route that I created above, what will happen is that, when a user navigates to &#8220;/employees&#8221; in your application, Ember will look for the following objects:</p><ul><li><em>App.EmployeesRoute</em></li><li><em>App.EmployeesController</em></li><li>the <em>employees</em> template</li></ul><p>If it doesn&#8217;t find them, it will create an instance of each but simply won&#8217;t render anything, since you haven&#8217;t specified a model to derive data from or a template to display to data with. This is why the naming convention is so important. It allows Ember to know how to handle the tasks associated with a specific route, without you having to wire things up manually.</p><p>Notice that, in the first example, I used the singular name, &#8220;Employee,&#8221; to define the model. That&#8217;s on purpose. The very nature of the name &#8220;Employees&#8221; dictates that I may be working with 0 to many employees, so it&#8217;s important to build a model that could provide the flexibility to return one employee or all employees. The singular naming convention of this model is not a requirement of Ember, as models themselves have no knowledge of the controllers that will use them later on. So you do have flexibility in naming them, but for consistency, sticking with this convention will making managing your code substantially easier.</p><p>Also, I chose to use the <em>resource()</em> method to define my route, because in this scenario, I would most likely have nested routes to manage detail pages for specific employee information. We&#8217;ll talk about nesting later in the series.</p><p>The key takeaway is that by using a consistent naming scheme, Ember can easily manage the hooks that bind these components together without your needing to explicitly define the relationships via a ton of code.</p><blockquote><p> Full details of <a
href="http://emberjs.com/guides/concepts/naming-conventions/">Ember&#8217;s naming conventions</a> are provided on the project&#8217;s site and is a <strong>must-read</strong>.</p></blockquote><hr

As I mentioned previously, Handlebars is the client-side library used in Ember and the expressions provided by the library are used extensively when creating the UI for your application. Here&#8217;s a simple example:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/x-handlebars&quot;&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{{firstName}} {{lastName}}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre><p>Notice that the expressions are mixed into your HTML markup and, via Ember, will dynamically change the content displayed on the page. In this case, the {{firstName}} and {{lastName}} placeholders will be replaced by data retrieved from the app.</p><p>Handlebars offers a lot of power, via a flexible API. It will be important for you to understand what it offers.</p><hr
/><h2>Routing</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> An application&#8217;s Router helps to manage the state of the application.</p></blockquote><p>An application&#8217;s Router helps to manage the state of the application and the resources needed as a user navigates the app. This can include tasks such as requesting data from a model, hooking up controllers to views, or displaying templates.</p><p>You do this by creating a route for specific locations within your application. Routes specify parts of the application and the URLs associated to them. The URL is the key identifier that Ember uses to understand which application state needs to be presented to the user.</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
App.Router.map( function() {
   this.route( 'about' ); // Takes us to &quot;/about&quot;
});
</pre><p>The behaviors of a route (e.g.: requesting data from a model) are managed via instances of the Ember route object and are fired when a user navigates to a specific URL. An example would be requesting data from a model, like this:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
App.EmployeesRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
   model: function() {
       return App.Employee.find();
   }
});
</pre><p>In this case, when a user navigates to the &#8220;/employees&#8221; section of the application, the route makes a request to the model for a list of all employees.</p><hr
/><h2>Models</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> An object representation of the data.</p></blockquote><p>Models are an object representation of the data your application will use. It could be a simple array or data dynamically retrieved from a RESTful JSON API, via an Ajax request. The <a
href="https://github.com/emberjs/data">Ember Data</a> library offers the API for loading, mapping and updating data to models within your application.</p><hr
/><h2>Controllers</h2><p>Controllers are typically used to store and represent model data and attributes. They act like a proxy, giving you access to the model&#8217;s attributes and allowing templates to access them to dynamically render the display. This is why a template will always be connected to a controller.</p><p>The main thing to remember is that, while a model retrieves data, a controller is what you&#8217;ll use to programmatically expose that data to different parts of your application. While it may seem that models and controllers are tightly coupled, in fact, models, themselves, have no knowledge of the controllers that will use them later on.</p><p>You can also store other application properties that need to persist but don&#8217;t need to be saved to a server.</p><hr
/><h2>Views</h2><p>Views in Ember.js are meant to manage events around user interaction and translate them into events that have meaning within your application. So, if a user clicks on a button to delete an employee, the view is responsible for interpreting that native browser click event and processing it appropriately within the context your application&#8217;s current state.</p><hr
/><h2>Naming Conventions</h2><p>One of the ways that Ember.js helps to minimize the amount of code needed and handle things for you behind the scenes is through naming conventions. The way that you define and name your routes (and resources) impacts the naming of your controllers, models, views and templates. For example, if I create a route, called &#8220;employees&#8221;:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
App.Router.map( function() {
   this.resource( 'employees' );
});
</pre><p>I would then name my components, like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Route object:</strong> <em>App.EmployeesRoute</em></li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> <em>App.EmployeesController</em></li><li><strong>Model:</strong> <em>App.Employee</em></li><li><strong>View:</strong> <em>App.EmployeesView</em></li><li><strong>Template:</strong> <em>employees</em></li></ul><p>Using this naming convention serves a dual purpose. First, it gives you a semantic relationship between like components. Secondly, Ember can automatically create the necessary objects that may not exist (e.g.: a route object or a controller) and wire them up for use in your application. This is the &#8220;magic&#8221; that I mentioned earlier. In fact, this is specifically what Ember does at the global Application level, when you instantiate the Application object:</p><p>var App = Ember.Application.create();</p><p>That single line creates the default references to the application&#8217;s router, controller, view and template.</p><ul><li><strong>Route object:</strong> <em>App.ApplicationRoute</em></li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> <em>App.ApplicationController</em></li><li><strong>View:</strong> <em>App.ApplicationView</em></li><li><strong>Template:</strong> <em>application</em></li></ul><p>Going back to the &#8220;employees&#8221; route that I created above, what will happen is that, when a user navigates to &#8220;/employees&#8221; in your application, Ember will look for the following objects:</p><ul><li><em>App.EmployeesRoute</em></li><li><em>App.EmployeesController</em></li><li>the <em>employees</em> template</li></ul><p>If it doesn&#8217;t find them, it will create an instance of each but simply won&#8217;t render anything, since you haven&#8217;t specified a model to derive data from or a template to display to data with. This is why the naming convention is so important. It allows Ember to know how to handle the tasks associated with a specific route, without you having to wire things up manually.</p><p>Notice that, in the first example, I used the singular name, &#8220;Employee,&#8221; to define the model. That&#8217;s on purpose. The very nature of the name &#8220;Employees&#8221; dictates that I may be working with 0 to many employees, so it&#8217;s important to build a model that could provide the flexibility to return one employee or all employees. The singular naming convention of this model is not a requirement of Ember, as models themselves have no knowledge of the controllers that will use them later on. So you do have flexibility in naming them, but for consistency, sticking with this convention will making managing your code substantially easier.</p><p>Also, I chose to use the <em>resource()</em> method to define my route, because in this scenario, I would most likely have nested routes to manage detail pages for specific employee information. We&#8217;ll talk about nesting later in the series.</p><p>The key takeaway is that by using a consistent naming scheme, Ember can easily manage the hooks that bind these components together without your needing to explicitly define the relationships via a ton of code.</p><blockquote><p> Full details of <a
href="http://emberjs.com/guides/concepts/naming-conventions/">Ember&#8217;s naming conventions</a> are provided on the project&#8217;s site and is a <strong>must-read</strong>.</p></blockquote><hr

The data is all in one place; so it&#8217;s easy to find, right? Not exactly. There are a couple problems with this table. First, there is repetitive data across columns. The &#8220;username&#8221; and &#8220;following_username&#8221; columns are repetitive, because both contain the same type of data &mdash; Twitter handles. There is another form of repetition within the &#8220;following_username&#8221; column. Fields should only contain one value, but each of the &#8220;following_username&#8221; fields contain two.</p><p>Second, there is repetitive data across rows.</p><blockquote><p>@AndyRyder5 and @Brett_Englebert each tweeted twice, so the rest of their information has been duplicated.</p></blockquote><p>Duplicates are problematic because it makes the CRUD operations more challenging. For example, it would take longer to retrieve data because time would be wasted going through duplicate rows. Also, updating data would be an issue; if a user changes their Twitter handle, we would need to find every duplicate and update it.</p><p>Repetitive data is a problem. We can fix this problem by splitting <strong>Table 1</strong> into separate tables. Let&#8217;s proceed with first resolving the repetition across columns issue.</p><hr

This repetition occurred because I was trying to express the follow relationship between users. Let&#8217;s improve on <strong>Table 1</strong>&#8216;s design by splitting it up into two tables: one just for the following relationships and one for the rest of the information.</p><div

/><h2><span>Step 4:</span> Linking Tables with Keys</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Data can be inserted, retrieved, updated, and deleted from a table.</p></blockquote><p>So far, <strong>Table 1</strong> has been split into three new tables: <em>following</em> (<strong>Table 2</strong>), <em>tweets</em> (<strong>Table 4</strong>), and <em>users</em> (<strong>Table 5</strong>). But how is this useful? Repetitive data has been removed, but now the data is spread out across three independent tables. In order to retrieve the data, we need to draw meaningful links between the tables. This way we can express queries like, &#8220;what a user has tweeted and who a user is following&#8221;.</p><p>The way to draw links between tables is to first give each row in a table a unique identifier, termed a primary key, and then reference that primary key in the other table to which you want to link.</p><p>We&#8217;ve actually already done this in <em>users</em> (<strong>Table 5</strong>) and <em>tweets</em> (<strong>Table 4</strong>). In <em>users</em>, the primary key is the &#8220;username&#8221; column because no two users will have the same Twitter handle. In <em>tweets</em>, we reference this key in the &#8220;username&#8221; column so we know who tweeted what. Since it is a reference, the &#8220;username&#8221; column in <em>tweets</em> is called a foreign key. In this way, the &#8220;username&#8221; key links the <em>users</em> and <em>tweets</em> tables together.</p><blockquote><p>Is the &#8220;username&#8221; column the best idea for a primary key for the <em>users</em> table?</p></blockquote><p>On one hand, it&#8217;s a natural key &mdash; it makes sense to search using a Twitter handle instead of assigning each user some numerical ID and searching on that. On the other hand, what if a user wants to change his Twitter handle? That could cause errors if the primary key and all referencing foreign keys aren&#8217;t updated accurately, errors that could be avoided if a constant numerical ID was used. Ultimately the choice depends on your system. If you want to give your users the ability to change their username, it&#8217;s better to add a numerical auto-incrementing &#8220;id&#8221; column to <em>users</em> and use that as the primary key. Otherwise, &#8220;username&#8221; should do just fine. I&#8217;ll continue to use &#8220;username&#8221; as the primary key for <em>users</em></p><p>Let&#8217;s move on to <em>tweets</em> (<strong>Table 4</strong>). A primary key should uniquely identify each row, so what should the primary key be here? The &#8220;created_at&#8221; field won&#8217;t work because if two users tweet at the exact same time, their tweets would have an identical timestamp. The &#8220;text&#8221; has the same problem in that if two users both tweet &#8220;Hello world,&#8221; we couldn&#8217;t distinguish between the rows. The &#8220;username&#8221; column is the foreign key that defines the link with the <em>users</em> so let&#8217;s not mess with that. Since the other columns are not good candidates, it makes sense here to add a numerical auto-incrementing &#8220;id&#8221; column and use that as the primary key.</p><p><strong>Table 6: The <em>tweets</em> table with an &#8220;id&#8221; column</strong></p><table><thead><tr

In this table, neither the &#8220;from_user&#8221; column nor the &#8220;to_user&#8221; column uniquely identifies each row on its own. However &#8220;from_user&#8221; and &#8220;to_user&#8221; together do, since they represent a single relationship. A primary key can be defined on more than one column, so we&#8217;ll use both these columns as the primary key for the <em>following</em> table.</p><p>As for the foreign key, &#8220;from_user&#8221; and &#8220;to_user&#8221; are each foreign keys since they can be used to define a link with the <em>users</em> table. If we query for a Twitter handle on the &#8220;from_user&#8221; column, we&#8217;ll get all the users he follows. Correspondingly, if we query for a Twitter handle on the &#8220;to_user&#8221; column, we&#8217;ll get all the users following him.</p><p>We&#8217;ve accomplished a lot so far. We removed repetitions across columns and rows by separating data into three different tables, and then we chose meaningful primary keys to link the tables together. This entire process is called normalization and its output is data that is cleanly organized according to the relational model. The consequence of this organization is that rows will appear in the database only once moving forward, which in turn make the CRUD operations easier.</p><p><strong>Fig. 4</strong> diagrams the finalized database schema.

/><h2>Relational Database Management Systems</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>There are small variations in SQL between each RDBMS vendor, termed SQL dialects.</p></blockquote><p>Now that we know how to design a relational database, how do we actually implement one? Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are software that let you create and use relational databases. There are several commercial and open source vendors to choose from. On the commercial side, <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html">Oracle Database</a>, <a
href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/">IBM DB2</a>, and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/default.aspx">Microsoft SQL Server</a> are three well known solutions. On the free and open source side, <a
href="http://www.mysql.com/products/">MySQL</a>, <a
href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, and <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> are three widely used solutions.</p><p>MySQL is used at just about every Internet company you have heard of. In context of this article, <a
href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/04/mysql-at-twitter.html">Twitter uses MySQL</a> to store their users&#8217; tweets.</p><p>SQLite is common in embedded systems. iOS and Android let developers use SQLite to manage their app&#8217;s private database.  Google Chrome uses SQLite to store your browsing history, cookies, and your thumbnails on the &#8220;Most visited&#8221; page.</p><p>PostgreSQL is also a widely used RDBMS. Its PostGIS extension supplements PostgreSQL with geospatial functions that make it useful for mapping applications. A notable user of PostgreSQL is <a
href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database">OpenStreetMap</a>.</p><hr
/><h2>Structured Query Language (SQL)</h2><p>Once you&#8217;ve downloaded and set up an RDBMS on your system, the next step is to create a database and tables inside of it in order to insert and manage your relational data. The way you do this is with Structured Query Language (SQL), which is the standard language for working with RDBMSs.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a brief overview of common SQL statements that are relevant to the example Twitter data above. I recommend you check out the <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-Cookbooks-OReilly-Anthony-Molinaro/dp/0596009763">SQL Cookbook</a> for a more complete application-driven list of SQL queries.</p><ul><li>Create a database, named &#8220;development&#8221;<pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate">
  CREATE DATABASE development;
  </pre></li><li>Create a table named &#8220;users&#8221;<pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate">
  CREATE TABLE users (
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    username VARCHAR(100)
  );
  </pre><p> RDBMSs require that each column in a table is given a data type. Here I&#8217;ve assigned the &#8220;full_name&#8221; and &#8220;username&#8221; columns the data type <code>VARCHAR</code> which is a string that can vary in width. I&#8217;ve arbitrarily set a max length of 100. A full list of data types <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#Data_types">can be found here</a>.</li><li>Insert a record (the Create operation in CRUD)<pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate">
  INSERT INTO users (full_name, username)
  VALUES (&quot;Boris Hadjur&quot;, &quot;_DreamLead&quot;);
  </pre></li><li>Retrieve all tweets belonging to @_DreamLead (the Retrieve operation in CRUD)<pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate">
  SELECT text, created_at FROM tweets WHERE username=&quot;_DreamLead&quot;;
  </pre></li><li>Update a user&#8217;s name (the Update operation in CRUD)<pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate">
  UPDATE users
  SET full_name=&quot;Boris H&quot;
  WHERE username=&quot;_DreamLead&quot;;
  </pre></li><li>Delete a user (the Delete operation in CRUD)</li><pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate">
  DELETE FROM users
  WHERE username=&quot;_DreamLead&quot;;
  </pre></li></ul><p>SQL is pretty similar to regular English sentences. There are small variations in SQL between each RDBMS vendor, termed SQL dialects, but the differences are not dramatic enough that you can&#8217;t easily transfer your SQL knowledge from one to the other.</p><hr
/><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we learned how to design a relational database. We took a collection of data and organizing it into related tables. We also briefly looked at RDBMS solutions and SQL. So get started by downloading an RDBMS and normalizing some of your data into a relational database today.</p><p><strong>Preview Image Source:</strong> FindIcons.com/Barry Mieny</p><div class="feedflare">

The &#8220;username&#8221; and &#8220;following_username&#8221; columns are repetitive, because both contain the same type of data &mdash; Twitter handles. There is another form of repetition within the &#8220;following_username&#8221; column. Fields should only contain one value, but each of the &#8220;following_username&#8221; fields contain two.</p><p>Second, there is repetitive data across rows.</p><blockquote><p>@AndyRyder5 and @Brett_Englebert each tweeted twice, so the rest of their information has been duplicated.</p></blockquote><p>Duplicates are problematic because it makes the CRUD operations more challenging. For example, it would take longer to retrieve data because time would be wasted going through duplicate rows. Also, updating data would be an issue; if a user changes their Twitter handle, we would need to find every duplicate and update it.</p><p>Repetitive data is a problem. We can fix this problem by splitting <strong>Table 1</strong> into separate tables. Let&#8217;s proceed with first resolving the repetition across columns issue.</p><hr

This repetition occurred because I was trying to express the follow relationship between users. Let&#8217;s improve on <strong>Table 1</strong>&#8216;s design by splitting it up into two tables: one just for the following relationships and one for the rest of the information.</p><div

/><h2><span>Step 4:</span> Linking Tables with Keys</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Data can be inserted, retrieved, updated, and deleted from a table.</p></blockquote><p>So far, <strong>Table 1</strong> has been split into three new tables: <em>following</em> (<strong>Table 2</strong>), <em>tweets</em> (<strong>Table 4</strong>), and <em>users</em> (<strong>Table 5</strong>). But how is this useful? Repetitive data has been removed, but now the data is spread out across three independent tables. In order to retrieve the data, we need to draw meaningful links between the tables. This way we can express queries like, &#8220;what a user has tweeted and who a user is following&#8221;.</p><p>The way to draw links between tables is to first give each row in a table a unique identifier, termed a primary key, and then reference that primary key in the other table to which you want to link.</p><p>We&#8217;ve actually already done this in <em>users</em> (<strong>Table 5</strong>) and <em>tweets</em> (<strong>Table 4</strong>). In <em>users</em>, the primary key is the &#8220;username&#8221; column because no two users will have the same Twitter handle. In <em>tweets</em>, we reference this key in the &#8220;username&#8221; column so we know who tweeted what. Since it is a reference, the &#8220;username&#8221; column in <em>tweets</em> is called a foreign key. In this way, the &#8220;username&#8221; key links the <em>users</em> and <em>tweets</em> tables together.</p><blockquote><p>Is the &#8220;username&#8221; column the best idea for a primary key for the <em>users</em> table?</p></blockquote><p>On one hand, it&#8217;s a natural key &mdash; it makes sense to search using a Twitter handle instead of assigning each user some numerical ID and searching on that. On the other hand, what if a user wants to change his Twitter handle? That could cause errors if the primary key and all referencing foreign keys aren&#8217;t updated accurately, errors that could be avoided if a constant numerical ID was used. Ultimately the choice depends on your system. If you want to give your users the ability to change their username, it&#8217;s better to add a numerical auto-incrementing &#8220;id&#8221; column to <em>users</em> and use that as the primary key. Otherwise, &#8220;username&#8221; should do just fine. I&#8217;ll continue to use &#8220;username&#8221; as the primary key for <em>users</em></p><p>Let&#8217;s move on to <em>tweets</em> (<strong>Table 4</strong>). A primary key should uniquely identify each row, so what should the primary key be here? The &#8220;created_at&#8221; field won&#8217;t work because if two users tweet at the exact same time, their tweets would have an identical timestamp. The &#8220;text&#8221; has the same problem in that if two users both tweet &#8220;Hello world,&#8221; we couldn&#8217;t distinguish between the rows. The &#8220;username&#8221; column is the foreign key that defines the link with the <em>users</em> so let&#8217;s not mess with that. Since the other columns are not good candidates, it makes sense here to add a numerical auto-incrementing &#8220;id&#8221; column and use that as the primary key.</p><p><strong>Table 6: The <em>tweets</em> table with an &#8220;id&#8221; column</strong></p><table><thead><tr

In this table, neither the &#8220;from_user&#8221; column nor the &#8220;to_user&#8221; column uniquely identifies each row on its own. However &#8220;from_user&#8221; and &#8220;to_user&#8221; together do, since they represent a single relationship. A primary key can be defined on more than one column, so we&#8217;ll use both these columns as the primary key for the <em>following</em> table.</p><p>As for the foreign key, &#8220;from_user&#8221; and &#8220;to_user&#8221; are each foreign keys since they can be used to define a link with the <em>users</em> table. If we query for a Twitter handle on the &#8220;from_user&#8221; column, we&#8217;ll get all the users he follows. Correspondingly, if we query for a Twitter handle on the &#8220;to_user&#8221; column, we&#8217;ll get all the users following him.</p><p>We&#8217;ve accomplished a lot so far. We removed repetitions across columns and rows by separating data into three different tables, and then we chose meaningful primary keys to link the tables together. This entire process is called normalization and its output is data that is cleanly organized according to the relational model. The consequence of this organization is that rows will appear in the database only once moving forward, which in turn make the CRUD operations easier.</p><p><strong>Fig. 4</strong> diagrams the finalized database schema.

/><h2>Relational Database Management Systems</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>There are small variations in SQL between each RDBMS vendor, termed SQL dialects.</p></blockquote><p>Now that we know how to design a relational database, how do we actually implement one? Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are software that let you create and use relational databases. There are several commercial and open source vendors to choose from. On the commercial side, <a
href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html">Oracle Database</a>, <a
href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/">IBM DB2</a>, and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/default.aspx">Microsoft SQL Server</a> are three well known solutions. On the free and open source side, <a
href="http://www.mysql.com/products/">MySQL</a>, <a
href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, and <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> are three widely used solutions.</p><p>MySQL is used at just about every Internet company you have heard of. In context of this article, <a
href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/04/mysql-at-twitter.html">Twitter uses MySQL</a> to store their users&#8217; tweets.</p><p>SQLite is common in embedded systems. iOS and Android let developers use SQLite to manage their app&#8217;s private database.  Google Chrome uses SQLite to store your browsing history, cookies, and your thumbnails on the &#8220;Most visited&#8221; page.</p><p>PostgreSQL is also a widely used RDBMS. Its PostGIS extension supplements PostgreSQL with geospatial functions that make it useful for mapping applications. A notable user of PostgreSQL is <a
href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database">OpenStreetMap</a>.</p><hr
/><h2>Structured Query Language (SQL)</h2><p>Once you&#8217;ve downloaded and set up an RDBMS on your system, the next step is to create a database and tables inside of it in order to insert and manage your relational data. The way you do this is with Structured Query Language (SQL), which is the standard language for working with RDBMSs.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a brief overview of common SQL statements that are relevant to the example Twitter data above. I recommend you check out the <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-Cookbooks-OReilly-Anthony-Molinaro/dp/0596009763">SQL Cookbook</a> for a more complete application-driven list of SQL queries.</p><ul><li>Create a database, named &#8220;development&#8221;<pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate">

  </pre><p> RDBMSs require that each column in a table is given a data type. Here I&#8217;ve assigned the &#8220;full_name&#8221; and &#8220;username&#8221; columns the data type <code>VARCHAR</code> which is a string that can vary in width.

href="#system-testing">system testing</a>.</p><h3 id="assertion"> <strong>Assertion</strong></h3><p>Assertions are statements that perform an actual check on the software&#8217;s output. In general, a single function called <code>assert</code> is enough to express any check. In practice, test libraries often have many assert functions to meet specific needs (such as <code>assertFalse</code>, <code>assertEqual</code> and more) to offer better analysis and friendlier output.</p><h3 id="behavior-testing"> <strong>Behavior Testing</strong></h3><p>A testing technique that incorporates <a
href="#test-double">test doubles</a> to the software, asserting that it calls correct methods in a correct order. See <a
href="#mock">mock</a> for an example. Also see <a
href="#state-testing">state testing</a>.</p><h3> <strong>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</strong></h3><p>A subset of TDD driven by the need of clearer communication and proper documentation. BDD is perhaps the biggest recent development in TDD.</p><blockquote><p>Its core idea is to replace confusing and developer-centric terminology (<em>tests</em>, <em>suites</em>, <em>assertions</em> etc) with <em>ubiquitous language</em> that all participating stakeholders (including non-technical staff, and, possibly, clients) can understand.</p></blockquote><p>See <a
href="#user-story">user story</a>.</p><h3 id="black-box-testing"> <strong>Black-Box Testing</strong></h3><p>A general principle in testing where the person writing tests does not know or avoids the internals of the software, choosing instead to test the public interface of the software strictly by its interface or specification. See <a
href="#white-box-testing">white-box testing</a>.</p><h3 id="boundary-value-testing"> <strong>Boundary-Value Testing</strong></h3><p>A strategy for writing tests to catch off-by-one and other similar types of errors. To perform boundary-value testing, test the inputs around certain possibly problematic boundaries. In case of integers, this might be <code>0</code>, <code>-1</code>, <code>MIN_INT</code>, <code>MAX_INT</code> and other similar values.</p><h3 id="dummy"> <strong>Dummy</strong></h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Assertions are statements that perform an actual check on the software&#8217;s output.</p></blockquote><p>A dummy is a type of <a
href="#test-double">test double</a> that is never used by the actual software, but is only used in testing to fill required parameters.</p><h3 id="fake"> <strong>Fake</strong></h3><p>Fakes are <a
href="#test-double">test doubles</a> that implement the required functionality in a way that is useful in testing, but which also effectively disqualifies it from being used in production environment. For example, a key-value database that stores all values in memory and loses them after every execution potentially allows tests to run faster, but its tendency to destroy data would not allow it to be used in production.</p><h3 id="fixture"> <strong>Fixture</strong></h3><p>A particular environment that must be set up before a test can be run. It generally consists of setting up all test doubles and other dependencies for the software under test: such as inserting predefined data into a <a
href="#fake">fake</a> database, setting up certain directory structure in the fake file system, setting up properties on the dependencies of software under test.</p><h3 id="functional-testing"> <strong>Functional Testing</strong></h3><p>A high level testing activity verifying that all business requirements of the product are met. Functional testing commonly involves using <a
href="#user-story">user stories</a> to focus on a higher level of requirements to cover as many usage scenarios as possible. See <a
href="#acceptance-testing">acceptance testing</a> and <a
href="#system-testing">system testing</a>. For example:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate"># In this example we check that the about page of the website is working as expected
open 'example.com'

assertThereIs 'We are a small Example company'
</pre><h3 id="green"> <strong>Green</strong></h3><p>A colloquialism for a passing collection of tests, or sometimes a particular passing test. See <a
href="#red">red</a>.</p><h3><strong>Integration Testing</strong></h3><p>A mid-level testing activity that verifies a certain set of modules work correctly together. Integration tests are like unit tests without using test doubles for a certain subset of dependencies, essentially testing the interactions between the software its dependencies. Example:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate"># In this example we check that the newly registered user,

href="#test-double">test double</a> created for a particular <a
href="#test">test</a> or <a
href="#test-case">test case</a>. It expects to be called a specific number of times and gives a predefined answer. At the end of the test, a mock raises an error if it was not called as many times as expected. A mock with strict expectations is part of the <a
href="#assertion">assertion</a> framework. Example:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate"># In this example we use a mock database to check that the form

# If the database has not been called at the end of the test,
# the mock itself will raise an assertion error.
db = new Mock Db
db.expect('save').once().with(name='john')
RegistrationForm(db, name='john').save()
</pre><h3><strong>Monkey-Patching</strong></h3><p>A way to extend and change the behavior of existing objects and classes in a programming language. Monkey-patching can be used as an alternative to dependency injection and <a

href="#functional-testing">functional testing</a>.</p><h3 id="setup"> <strong>Setup</strong></h3><p>A process of preparing a <a

# that we will need across multiple tests
db = new Fake Db
db.createUser(name='john')

</pre><h3 id="state-testing"> <strong>State Testing</strong></h3><p>A form of unit testing when the testing code provides <a

href="#behavior-testing">behavior testing</a>.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate"># In this example, like in an example on mock objects,
# we will check that the form uses the database to store the new user.
# This time we will check state, instead of behavior
db = new Fake Db
RegistrationForm(db, name='john').save()
assertInList('john', db.listUsers())
</pre><h3 id="stub"> <strong>Stub</strong></h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Fakes are <a
href="#test-double">test doubles</a> that are never used by the actual software.</p></blockquote><p>A type of <a
href="#test-double">test double</a> that can reply to the software being tested with predefined answers. Unlike <a
href="#mock">mocks</a>, however, stubs do not usually check if they have been called properly, but rather only make sure that the software can call its dependencies.</p><h3 id="system-testing"> <strong>System Testing</strong></h3><p>A high level testing activity when the entirety of the software is tested top to bottom. This includes <a
href="#functional-testing">functional testing</a>, as well as checking other characteristics (such as performance and stability).</p><h3><strong>SUT</strong></h3><p>An abbreviation for <em>software under test</em>. Used to distinguish the software under test from its dependencies.</p><h3 id="teardown"> <strong>Teardown</strong></h3><p>A process of cleaning up a <a
href="#fixture">fixture</a>. In garbage-collected languages, this functionality is mostly handled automatically. See <a
href="#setup">setup</a>.</p><h3 id="test"> <strong>Test</strong></h3><p>The smallest possible check for correctness. For example, a single test for a web form could be a check that, when given an invalid email address, the form warns the user and suggests a fix. See <a
href="#test-case">test case</a>.</p><h3 id="test-case"> <strong>Test Case</strong></h3><p>A collection of <a
href="#test">tests</a> grouped by an attribute. For example, a test case for a web form could be a collection of tests checking the behavior of the form for different valid and invalid inputs.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">function t1:
    assertNoError(
        RegistrationForm(name='john', password='horse battery staple correct').save()
    )

function t2:
    assertError(MissingPassword, RegistrationForm(name='john').save())

function t3:
    assertError(StupidPassword, RegistrationForm(name='john', password='password').save())
</pre><h3 id="test-coverage"> <strong>Test Coverage</strong></h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>User stories are usually defined in human languages to focus on user experience instead.</p></blockquote><p>Any kind of metric that attempts to estimate the likelihood of important behavior of the SUT still not covered by tests. Most popular techniques include different kinds of <em>code coverage</em>: techniques that make sure that all possible code statements (or functions, or logical branches in the code) have been executed during testing.</p><h3><strong>Test Cycle</strong></h3><p>A process of TDD development. Given that TDD development starts with writing a few tests, it is clear that the <a
href="#test-suite">test suite</a> starts <a
href="#red">red</a>. As soon as the developer implements all newly tested functionality, tests turn <a
href="#green">green</a>. Now the developer can safely <a
href="#refactoring">refactor</a> his implementation without the risk of introducing new bugs, as he has a test suite to rely on. Once refactoring is complete, the developer can start the cycle again by writing more tests for more new functionality. Thus, the <em>red-green-refactor test cycle</em>.</p><h3 id="test-double"><p><strong>Test Double</strong></h3><p>Test doubles are objects the test code creates and passes to the SUT to replace real dependencies. For example, <a
href="#unit-testing">unit tests</a> should be very fast and only test a particular piece of software.</p><blockquote><p>For these reasons, its dependencies, such as a database or file system interaction libraries, are usually replaced by objects that act in memory instead of talking to a real database or file system.</p></blockquote><p>There are four main categories of test doubles: <a
href="#dummy">dummies</a>, <a
href="#fake">fakes</a>, <a
href="#stub">stubs</a>, and <a
href="#mock">mocks</a>.</p><h3> <strong>Test Suite</strong></h3><p>A collection of <a
href="#test-case">test cases</a> that test a large portion of software. Alternatively, all test cases for a particular software.</p><h3><strong>Test-First Programming</strong></h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>White-box testing allows a deeper analysis of possible problems in the code.</p></blockquote><p>Test-first programming is a slightly broader term for test-driven development. While TDD promotes tight coupling between writing tests (usually <a
href="#unit-testing">unit tests</a>) and writing the code, test-first programming allows for high level functional tests instead. However, the distinction in general usage is rarely noted, and two the terms are usually used interchangeably.</p><h3 id="unit-testing"> <strong>Unit Testing</strong></h3><p>The lowest level testing technique consisting of test cases for the smallest possible units of code. A single unit test usually checks only a particular small behavior, and a unit <a
href="#test-case">test case</a> usually covers all functionality of a particular single function or class.</p><h3 id="user-story"> <strong>User Story</strong></h3><p>A single description of a particular group of people willing to perform a particular task using the SUT to achieve a particular goal. User stories are usually defined in human languages, using simple, user-centric terms to avoid considering implementation details and to focus on user experience instead. For example:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">As a user, I want to be able to find my friends on this website by my address book, instead of looking for them one by one, because that will save me a lot of time.</pre><h3 id="white-box-testing"> <strong>White-Box Testing</strong></h3><p>White-box testing is a testing technique when a person performing the testing knows about, or can read, the internals of the SUT. Unlike the more common <a
href="#black-box-testing">black-box testing</a>, white-box testing allows a deeper analysis of possible problems in the code.</p><blockquote><p>For example, a particular <a
href="#boundary-value-testing">boundary value</a> might not look like one based solely on the specification of the software, but it might be obvious from the implementation of it.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, any <a
href="#test-coverage">test coverage</a> techniques are usually, by definition, a part of white-box testing.</p><div class="feedflare">

Instead, in this article, we will more discuss the <i>when</i> and <i>why</i>, rather than the <i>which</i> and <i>how</i>.</p><p>I&#8217;ll present different situations and use-cases for patterns, and will also provide short definitions to help those of you who are not so familiar with these specific patterns. Let&#8217;s get started.</p><p><span
id="more-27862"></span></p> October, 2012<p>This article covers some of the various <i>Agile Design Patterns</i>, documented in Robert C. Martin&#8217;s books. These patterns are modern adaptations of the original design patterns defined and documented by <i><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" title="GoF: Design Patterns" target="_blank">The Gang of Four</a></i> in 1994. Martin&#8217;s patterns present a much more recent take on the GoF&#8217;s patterns, and they work better with modern programming techniques and problems. In fact, about 15% of the original patterns were replaced with newer patterns, and the remaining patterns were slightly modernized.</p><hr
/><h2>Let&#8217;s Start by Creating Some Objects</h2><h3>Use a Factory Pattern</h3><p>The factory pattern was invented to help programmers organize the information related to object creation. Objects sometimes have lot of constructor parameters; other times, they must be populated with default information immediately after their creation. These objects should be created in factories, keeping all the information regarding their creation and initialization contained within a single place.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When</strong> Use a Factory Pattern when you find yourself writing code to gather information necessary to create objects.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Factories help to contain the logic of object creation in a single place. They can also break dependencies to facilitate loose coupling and dependency injection to allow for better testing.</p></div><hr
/><h2>Finding the Data We Need</h2><p>There are two frequently used patterns to retrieve information from a persistence layer or external data source.</p><h3>The Gateway Pattern</h3><p>This pattern defines a communication channel between a persistence solution and the business logic. For simpler applications, it can retrieve or recreate whole objects by itself, but object creation is the responsibility of factories in most complex applications. Gateways simply retrieve and persist raw data.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> When you need to retrieve or persist information.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It offers a simple public interface for complicated persistence operations. It also encapsulates persistence knowledge and decouples business logic from persistence logic.</p></div><p>In fact, the gateway pattern is just a particular implementation of another design pattern that we&#8217;ll discuss shortly: the adapter pattern.</p><h3>Go with the Proxy</h3><p>There are times when you can not (or do not want to) expose the knowledge of the persistence layer to your business classes. The proxy pattern is a good way to fool your business classes into thinking they are using already existing objects.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You have to retrieve information from a persistence layer or external source, but don&#8217;t want your business logic to know this.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To offer a non-intrusive approach to creating objects behind the scenes. It also opens the possibility to retrieve these object on the fly, lazily, and from different sources.</p></div><p>A proxy effectively implements the same interface as a real object and mimics its functionality. The business logic simply uses it as if it were a real object, but in fact, the proxy creates the object if one doesn&#8217;t exist.</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>The active object pattern also played a part in early multi-tasking systems.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, okay. That great and all, but how can we find the objects that we need to create?</p><h3>Ask a Repository</h3><p>The repository pattern is very useful for implementing search methods and mini-query languages. It takes these queries and uses a gateway to obtain the data for a factory to produce the objects you need.</p><p>The repository pattern is different from the other patterns; it exists as part of Domain Driven Design (DDD), and is not included as part of Robert C. Martin&#8217;s book.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You need to create multiple objects based on search criteria, or when you need to save multiple objects to the persistence layer.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To let clients that need specific objects to work with a common and well isolated query and persistence language. It removes even more creation-related code from the business logic.</p></div><p>But what if the repository cannot find the objects? One option would be to return a <code>NULL</code> value, but doing so has two side effects:</p><ul><li>It throws a <i>refused bequest</i> if you try to call a method on such an object.</li><li>It forces you to include numerous null checks (<code>if(is_null($param)) return;</code>) in your code.</li></ul><p>A better approach is to return a <code>null</code> object.</p><h3>The Null Object Pattern</h3><p>A null object implements the same interface of your other objects, but the object&#8217;s members return a neutral value. For example, a method that returns a string would return an empty string; another member returning a numeric value would return zero. This forces you to implement methods that do not return meaningful data, but you can use these objects without worrying about refused bequest or littering your code with null checks.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You frequently check for <code>null</code> or you have refused bequests.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It can add clarity to your code and forces you to think more about the behavior of your objects.</p></div><p>It&#8217;s not unusual to call many methods on an object before it can do its job. There are situations when you must prepare an object after its creation before you can truly use it. This leads to code duplication when creating those objects in different places.</p><h3>You Need the Command Pattern</h3><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> When you have to perform many operations to prepare objects for use.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To move complexity from the consuming code to the creating code.</p></div><p>This sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it? In fact, it is quite useful in many situations. The command pattern is widely used for implementing transactions. If you add a simple <code>undo()</code> method to a command object, it can track all the undo transactions it performed and reverse them if necessary.</p><p>So now you have ten (or more) command objects, and you want them running concurrently. You can gather them into an active object.</p><h3>The Active Object</h3><p>The simple and interesting active object has only one responsibility: keep a list of command objects and run them.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> Several similar objects have to execute with a single command.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It forces clients to perform a single task and affect multiple objects.</p></div><p>An active object removes each command from its list after the command&#8217;s execution; meaning, you can execute the command only once. Some real world examples of an active object are:</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Design patterns are here to solve problems.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Shopping Cart</strong> &#8211; Executing a <code>buy()</code> command on each product removes them from the cart.</li><li><strong>Financial Transactions</strong> &#8211; Grouping transactions into a single list and executing them with a simple call to the list manager&#8217;s active object would remove the transactions from the queue.</li></ul><p>The active object pattern also played a part in early multi-tasking systems. Each object inside an active object would keep a reference to the active object. They would execute a portion of their jobs and then put themselves back into the queue. Even in today&#8217;s systems, you can use an active object to let other objects work while you wait for a response from another application.</p><hr
/><h2>Reusability</h2><p>I am positive that you&#8217;ve heard the big promise of object oriented programming: code reuse. Early adopters of OOP envisioned using universal libraries and classes in millions of different projects. Well, it never happened.</p><h3>Make Some Template Methods Instead</h3><p>This pattern allows for the partial reuse of code. It&#8217;s practical with multiple algorithms which only slightly differ from one another.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> Eliminate duplication in a simple way.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> There is duplication and flexibility is not a problem.</p></div><p>But flexibility is nice. What if I really need it?</p><h3>It&#8217;s Time For a Strategy</h3><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> Flexibility and reusability is more important than simplicity.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Use it to implement big, interchangeable chunks of complicated logic, while keeping a common algorithm signature.</p></div><p>For example, you can create a generic <code>Calculator</code> and then use different <code>ComputationStrategy</code> objects to perform the calculations. This is a moderately used pattern, and it is most powerful when you have to define many conditional behaviors.</p><hr
/><h2>Discover-ability</h2><p>As projects grow, it becomes increasingly difficult for external users to access our application. That&#8217;s one reason to offer a well-defined entry point to the application or module in question. Other such reasons may include the desire to conceal the module&#8217;s internal workings and structure.</p><h3>Present a Facade</h3><p>A facade is essentially an API &#8211; a nice and client-facing interface. When a client calls one of these nice methods, the facade delegates a series of calls to the classes it hides in order to provide the client with the required information or desired result.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> To simplify your API or intentionally conceal inner business logic.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> You can control the API and the real implementations and logic independently.</p></div><p>Control is good, and many times you need to perform a task when something changes. Users have to be notified, red LEDs have to blink, an alarm has to sound&#8230; you get the idea.</p><blockquote><p> The popular <a
href="http://laravel.com">Laravel</a> framework makes excellent use of the Facade Pattern.</p></blockquote><h3>Subscribe to an Observer</h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>A null object implements the same interface as your other objects.</p></blockquote><p>The observer pattern offers an easy way to monitor objects and take actions when conditions change. There are two types of observer implementations:</p><ul><li><strong>Polling</strong> &#8211; Objects accept subscribers. Subscribers observe the object and are notified on specific events. Subscribers <i>ask</i> the observed objects for more information in order to take an action.</li><li><strong>Push</strong> &#8211; Like the polling method, objects accept subscribers, and subscribers are notified when an event occurs. But when a notification happens, <i>the observer also receives a hint</i> that the observer can act on.</li></ul><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> To provide a notification system inside your business logic or to the outside world.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> The pattern offers a way to communicate events to any number of different objects.</p></div><p>Use cases for this pattern are email notifications, logging daemons, or messaging systems. Of course, in real life, there are countless other ways to use it.</p><h3>Coordinate The Effects</h3><p>The observer pattern can be extended with a mediator pattern. This pattern takes two objects as parameters. The mediator subscribes itself to the first parameter, and when a change happens to the observed object, the mediator decides what to do on the second object.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> The affected objects can not know about the observed objects.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To offer a hidden mechanism of affecting other objects in the system when one object changes.</p></div><hr
/><h2>Singularity</h2><p>Sometimes, you need special objects that are unique in your application, and you want to ensure that all consumers can see any change made to these objects. You also want to prevent creating multiple instances of such objects for certain reasons, like long initialization time or problems with concurrent actions to some third party libraries.</p><h3>Use a Singleton</h3><p>A singleton is an object having a private constructor and a public <code>getInstance()</code> method. This method ensures that only one instance of the object exists.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You need to achieve singularity and want a cross platform, lazily evaluated solution which also offers the possibility of creation through derivation.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To offer a single point of access when needed.</p></div><h3>Or Write a Monostate Object</h3><p>Another approach to singularity is the monostate design pattern. This solution uses a trick offered by object oriented programming languages. It has dynamic public methods which get or set the values of static private variables. This, in turn, ensures that all instances of such classes share the same values.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> Transparency, derivabitility, and polymorphism are preferred together with singularity.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To hide from the users/clients the fact that the object offers singularity.</p></div><p>Pay special attention to singularity. It pollutes the global namespace and, in most cases, can be replaced with something better suited for that particular situation.</p><hr
/><h2>Controlling Different Objects</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>The repository pattern is quite useful for implementing search methods&#8230;</p></blockquote><p>So you have a switch and a light. The switch can turn the light on and off, but, now, you&#8217;ve purchased a fan and want to use your old switch with it. That&#8217;s easy to accomplish in the physical world; take the switch, connect the wires, and viola.</p><p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not so easy in the programming world. You have a <code>Switch</code> class and a <code>Light</code> class. If your <code>Switch</code> uses the <code>Light</code>, how could it use the <code>Fan</code>?</p><p>Easy! Copy and paste the <code>Switch</code>, and change it to use the <code>Fan</code>. But that&#8217;s code duplication; it&#8217;s the equivalent of buying another switch for the fan. You could extend <code>Switch</code> to <code>FanSwitch</code>, and use that object instead. But what if you want to use a <code>Button</code> or <code>RemoteControl</code>, instead of a <code>Switch</code>?</p><h3>The Abstract Server Pattern</h3><p>This is the simplest pattern ever invented. It only uses an interface. That&#8217;s it, but there are several different implementations.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You need to connect objects and maintain flexibility.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Because it is the simplest way to achieve flexibility, while respecting both the dependency inversion principle and the open close principle.</p></div><p>PHP is dynamically typed. This means that you can omit interfaces and use different objects in the same context &#8211; risking a refused bequest. However, PHP also allows for the definition of interfaces, and I recommend you use this great functionality to provide clarity to the intent of your source code.</p><p>But you already have a bunch of classes you want to talk to? Yes, of course. There are many libraries, third-party APIs, and other modules that one has to talk to, but this does not mean that our business logic has to know the details of such things.</p><h3>Plug in an Adapter</h3><p>The adapter pattern simply creates a correspondence between the business logic and something else. We have already seen such a pattern in action: the gateway pattern.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You need to create a connection with a pre-existing and potentially changing module, library, or API.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To allow your business logic to rely only on the public methods the adapter offers, and permit changing the other side of the adapter easily.</p></div><p>If either of the above patterns don&#8217;t fit with your situation, then you could use&#8230;</p><h3>The Bridge Pattern</h3><p>This is a very complicated pattern. I personally do not like it because it is usually easier to take a different approach. But for those special cases, when other solutions fail, you can consider the bridge pattern.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> The adapter pattern is not enough, and you change classes on both sides of the pipe.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To offer increased flexibility at the cost of significant complexity.</p></div><hr
/><h2>The Composite Pattern</h2><p>Consider that you have a script with similar commands, and you want make a single call to run them. Wait! Didn&#8217;t we already see something like this earlier? The active object pattern?</p><p>Yes, yes we did. But this one is a bit different. It&#8217;s the composite pattern, and like the active object pattern, it keeps a list of objects. But calling a method on a composite object calls the same method on all of its objects without removing them from the list. The clients calling a method are thinking they are talking to a single object of that particular type, but in fact, their actions are applied to many, many objects of the same type.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You have to apply an action to several similar objects.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To reduce duplication and simplify how similar objects are called.</p></div><p>Here&#8217;s an example: you have an application that is capable of creating and placing <code>Orders</code>. Assume you have three orders: <code>$order1</code>, <code>$order2</code> and <code>$order3</code>. You could call <code>place()</code> on each of them, or you could contain those orders in a <code>$compositeOrder</code> object, and call its <code>place()</code> method. This, in turn, calls the <code>place()</code> method on all the contained <code>Order</code> objects.</p><hr
/><h2>The State Pattern</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Gateways only retrieve and persist raw data.</p></blockquote><p>A finite state machine (FSM) is a model that has a finite number of discreet states. Implementing a FSM can be difficult, and the easiest way to do so involves the trusty <code>switch</code> statement. Each <code>case</code> statement represents a current state in the machine, and it knows how to activate the next state.</p><p>But we all know that <code>switch...case</code> statements are less desirable because they produce an unwanted high fan-out on our objects. So forget the <code>switch...case</code> statement, and instead consider the state pattern. The state pattern is composed of several objects: an object to coordinate things, an interface representing an abstract state, and then several implementations &#8211; one for each state. Each state knows which state comes after it, and the state can notify the coordinating object to set its new state to the next in line.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> FSM-like logic is required to be implemented.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To eliminate the problems of a <code>switch...case</code> statement, and to better encapsulate the meaning of each individual state.</p></div><p>A food dispenser could have a <code>main</code> class that has a reference to a <code>state</code> class. Possible state classes might be something like: <code>WaitingForCoin</code>, <code>InsertedCoin</code>, <code>SelectedProduct</code>, <code>WaitingForConfirmation</code>, <code>DeliveringProduct</code>, <code>ReturningChange</code>. Each state performs its job and creates the next state object to send to the coordinator class.</p><hr
/><h2>Decorate with the Decorator Pattern</h2><p>There are times when you deploy classes or modules throughout an application, and you can&#8217;t modify them without radically affecting the system. But, at the same time, you need to add new functionality that your users require.</p><p>The decorator pattern can aid in these situations. It is very simple: take existing functionality and add to it. This is accomplished by extending the original class and providing new functionality at run-time. Old clients continue to use the new object as they would an old one, and new clients will use both the old and new functionality.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You can&#8217;t change old classes, but you have to implement new behavior or state.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It offers an unintrusive way of adding new functionality.</p></div><p>A simple example is printing data. You print some information to the user as plain text, but you also want to provide the ability to print in HTML. The decorator pattern is one such solution that lets you keep both functionality.</p><h3>Or, Accept a Visitor</h3><p>If your problem of extending functionality is different &#8211; say, you have a complex tree-like structure of objects, and you want to add functionality to many nodes at once &#8211; a simple iteration is not possible, but a visitor might be a viable solution. The downside, however, is that a visitor pattern implementation requires modification to the old class if it wasn&#8217;t designed to accept a visitor.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> A decorator is not appropriate and some extra complexity is acceptable.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To allow and organized approach to defining functionality for several objects but at the price of higher complexity.</p></div><hr
/><h2>Conclusion</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Use design patterns to solve your problems, but only if they fit.</p></blockquote><p>Design patterns help solve problems. As an implementation recommendation, never name your classes after the patterns. Instead, find the right names for the right abstractions.

Instead, in this article, we will more discuss the <i>when</i> and <i>why</i>, rather than the <i>which</i> and <i>how</i>.</p><p>I&#8217;ll present different situations and use-cases for patterns, and will also provide short definitions to help those of you who are not so familiar with these specific patterns. Let&#8217;s get started.</p><p><span
id="more-27862"></span></p> October, 2012<p>This article covers some of the various <i>Agile Design Patterns</i>, documented in Robert C. Martin&#8217;s books. These patterns are modern adaptations of the original design patterns defined and documented by <i><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" title="GoF: Design Patterns" target="_blank">The Gang of Four</a></i> in 1994. Martin&#8217;s patterns present a much more recent take on the GoF&#8217;s patterns, and they work better with modern programming techniques and problems. In fact, about 15% of the original patterns were replaced with newer patterns, and the remaining patterns were slightly modernized.</p><hr
/><h2>Let&#8217;s Start by Creating Some Objects</h2><h3>Use a Factory Pattern</h3><p>The factory pattern was invented to help programmers organize the information related to object creation. Objects sometimes have lot of constructor parameters; other times, they must be populated with default information immediately after their creation. These objects should be created in factories, keeping all the information regarding their creation and initialization contained within a single place.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When</strong> Use a Factory Pattern when you find yourself writing code to gather information necessary to create objects.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Factories help to contain the logic of object creation in a single place. They can also break dependencies to facilitate loose coupling and dependency injection to allow for better testing.</p></div><hr
/><h2>Finding the Data We Need</h2><p>There are two frequently used patterns to retrieve information from a persistence layer or external data source.</p><h3>The Gateway Pattern</h3><p>This pattern defines a communication channel between a persistence solution and the business logic. For simpler applications, it can retrieve or recreate whole objects by itself, but object creation is the responsibility of factories in most complex applications. Gateways simply retrieve and persist raw data.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> When you need to retrieve or persist information.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It offers a simple public interface for complicated persistence operations. It also encapsulates persistence knowledge and decouples business logic from persistence logic.</p></div><p>In fact, the gateway pattern is just a particular implementation of another design pattern that we&#8217;ll discuss shortly: the adapter pattern.</p><h3>Go with the Proxy</h3><p>There are times when you can not (or do not want to) expose the knowledge of the persistence layer to your business classes. The proxy pattern is a good way to fool your business classes into thinking they are using already existing objects.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You have to retrieve information from a persistence layer or external source, but don&#8217;t want your business logic to know this.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To offer a non-intrusive approach to creating objects behind the scenes. It also opens the possibility to retrieve these object on the fly, lazily, and from different sources.</p></div><p>A proxy effectively implements the same interface as a real object and mimics its functionality. The business logic simply uses it as if it were a real object, but in fact, the proxy creates the object if one doesn&#8217;t exist.</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>The active object pattern also played a part in early multi-tasking systems.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, okay. That great and all, but how can we find the objects that we need to create?</p><h3>Ask a Repository</h3><p>The repository pattern is very useful for implementing search methods and mini-query languages. It takes these queries and uses a gateway to obtain the data for a factory to produce the objects you need.</p><p>The repository pattern is different from the other patterns; it exists as part of Domain Driven Design (DDD), and is not included as part of Robert C. Martin&#8217;s book.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You need to create multiple objects based on search criteria, or when you need to save multiple objects to the persistence layer.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To let clients that need specific objects to work with a common and well isolated query and persistence language. It removes even more creation-related code from the business logic.</p></div><p>But what if the repository cannot find the objects? One option would be to return a <code>NULL</code> value, but doing so has two side effects:</p><ul><li>It throws a <i>refused bequest</i> if you try to call a method on such an object.</li><li>It forces you to include numerous null checks (<code>if(is_null($param)) return;</code>) in your code.</li></ul><p>A better approach is to return a <code>null</code> object.</p><h3>The Null Object Pattern</h3><p>A null object implements the same interface of your other objects, but the object&#8217;s members return a neutral value. For example, a method that returns a string would return an empty string; another member returning a numeric value would return zero. This forces you to implement methods that do not return meaningful data, but you can use these objects without worrying about refused bequest or littering your code with null checks.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You frequently check for <code>null</code> or you have refused bequests.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It can add clarity to your code and forces you to think more about the behavior of your objects.</p></div><p>It&#8217;s not unusual to call many methods on an object before it can do its job. There are situations when you must prepare an object after its creation before you can truly use it. This leads to code duplication when creating those objects in different places.</p><h3>You Need the Command Pattern</h3><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> When you have to perform many operations to prepare objects for use.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To move complexity from the consuming code to the creating code.</p></div><p>This sounds good, doesn&#8217;t it? In fact, it is quite useful in many situations. The command pattern is widely used for implementing transactions. If you add a simple <code>undo()</code> method to a command object, it can track all the undo transactions it performed and reverse them if necessary.</p><p>So now you have ten (or more) command objects, and you want them running concurrently. You can gather them into an active object.</p><h3>The Active Object</h3><p>The simple and interesting active object has only one responsibility: keep a list of command objects and run them.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> Several similar objects have to execute with a single command.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It forces clients to perform a single task and affect multiple objects.</p></div><p>An active object removes each command from its list after the command&#8217;s execution; meaning, you can execute the command only once. Some real world examples of an active object are:</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Design patterns are here to solve problems.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Shopping Cart</strong> &#8211; Executing a <code>buy()</code> command on each product removes them from the cart.</li><li><strong>Financial Transactions</strong> &#8211; Grouping transactions into a single list and executing them with a simple call to the list manager&#8217;s active object would remove the transactions from the queue.</li></ul><p>The active object pattern also played a part in early multi-tasking systems. Each object inside an active object would keep a reference to the active object. They would execute a portion of their jobs and then put themselves back into the queue. Even in today&#8217;s systems, you can use an active object to let other objects work while you wait for a response from another application.</p><hr
/><h2>Reusability</h2><p>I am positive that you&#8217;ve heard the big promise of object oriented programming: code reuse. Early adopters of OOP envisioned using universal libraries and classes in millions of different projects. Well, it never happened.</p><h3>Make Some Template Methods Instead</h3><p>This pattern allows for the partial reuse of code. It&#8217;s practical with multiple algorithms which only slightly differ from one another.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> Eliminate duplication in a simple way.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> There is duplication and flexibility is not a problem.</p></div><p>But flexibility is nice. What if I really need it?</p><h3>It&#8217;s Time For a Strategy</h3><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> Flexibility and reusability is more important than simplicity.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Use it to implement big, interchangeable chunks of complicated logic, while keeping a common algorithm signature.</p></div><p>For example, you can create a generic <code>Calculator</code> and then use different <code>ComputationStrategy</code> objects to perform the calculations. This is a moderately used pattern, and it is most powerful when you have to define many conditional behaviors.</p><hr
/><h2>Discover-ability</h2><p>As projects grow, it becomes increasingly difficult for external users to access our application. That&#8217;s one reason to offer a well-defined entry point to the application or module in question. Other such reasons may include the desire to conceal the module&#8217;s internal workings and structure.</p><h3>Present a Facade</h3><p>A facade is essentially an API &#8211; a nice and client-facing interface. When a client calls one of these nice methods, the facade delegates a series of calls to the classes it hides in order to provide the client with the required information or desired result.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> To simplify your API or intentionally conceal inner business logic.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> You can control the API and the real implementations and logic independently.</p></div><p>Control is good, and many times you need to perform a task when something changes. Users have to be notified, red LEDs have to blink, an alarm has to sound&#8230; you get the idea.</p><blockquote><p> The popular <a
href="http://laravel.com">Laravel</a> framework makes excellent use of the Facade Pattern.</p></blockquote><h3>Subscribe to an Observer</h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>A null object implements the same interface as your other objects.</p></blockquote><p>The observer pattern offers an easy way to monitor objects and take actions when conditions change. There are two types of observer implementations:</p><ul><li><strong>Polling</strong> &#8211; Objects accept subscribers. Subscribers observe the object and are notified on specific events. Subscribers <i>ask</i> the observed objects for more information in order to take an action.</li><li><strong>Push</strong> &#8211; Like the polling method, objects accept subscribers, and subscribers are notified when an event occurs. But when a notification happens, <i>the observer also receives a hint</i> that the observer can act on.</li></ul><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> To provide a notification system inside your business logic or to the outside world.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> The pattern offers a way to communicate events to any number of different objects.</p></div><p>Use cases for this pattern are email notifications, logging daemons, or messaging systems. Of course, in real life, there are countless other ways to use it.</p><h3>Coordinate The Effects</h3><p>The observer pattern can be extended with a mediator pattern. This pattern takes two objects as parameters. The mediator subscribes itself to the first parameter, and when a change happens to the observed object, the mediator decides what to do on the second object.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> The affected objects can not know about the observed objects.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To offer a hidden mechanism of affecting other objects in the system when one object changes.</p></div><hr
/><h2>Singularity</h2><p>Sometimes, you need special objects that are unique in your application, and you want to ensure that all consumers can see any change made to these objects. You also want to prevent creating multiple instances of such objects for certain reasons, like long initialization time or problems with concurrent actions to some third party libraries.</p><h3>Use a Singleton</h3><p>A singleton is an object having a private constructor and a public <code>getInstance()</code> method. This method ensures that only one instance of the object exists.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You need to achieve singularity and want a cross platform, lazily evaluated solution which also offers the possibility of creation through derivation.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To offer a single point of access when needed.</p></div><h3>Or Write a Monostate Object</h3><p>Another approach to singularity is the monostate design pattern. This solution uses a trick offered by object oriented programming languages. It has dynamic public methods which get or set the values of static private variables. This, in turn, ensures that all instances of such classes share the same values.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> Transparency, derivabitility, and polymorphism are preferred together with singularity.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To hide from the users/clients the fact that the object offers singularity.</p></div><p>Pay special attention to singularity. It pollutes the global namespace and, in most cases, can be replaced with something better suited for that particular situation.</p><hr
/><h2>Controlling Different Objects</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>The repository pattern is quite useful for implementing search methods&#8230;</p></blockquote><p>So you have a switch and a light. The switch can turn the light on and off, but, now, you&#8217;ve purchased a fan and want to use your old switch with it. That&#8217;s easy to accomplish in the physical world; take the switch, connect the wires, and viola.</p><p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not so easy in the programming world. You have a <code>Switch</code> class and a <code>Light</code> class. If your <code>Switch</code> uses the <code>Light</code>, how could it use the <code>Fan</code>?</p><p>Easy! Copy and paste the <code>Switch</code>, and change it to use the <code>Fan</code>. But that&#8217;s code duplication; it&#8217;s the equivalent of buying another switch for the fan. You could extend <code>Switch</code> to <code>FanSwitch</code>, and use that object instead. But what if you want to use a <code>Button</code> or <code>RemoteControl</code>, instead of a <code>Switch</code>?</p><h3>The Abstract Server Pattern</h3><p>This is the simplest pattern ever invented. It only uses an interface. That&#8217;s it, but there are several different implementations.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You need to connect objects and maintain flexibility.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Because it is the simplest way to achieve flexibility, while respecting both the dependency inversion principle and the open close principle.</p></div><p>PHP is dynamically typed. This means that you can omit interfaces and use different objects in the same context &#8211; risking a refused bequest. However, PHP also allows for the definition of interfaces, and I recommend you use this great functionality to provide clarity to the intent of your source code.</p><p>But you already have a bunch of classes you want to talk to? Yes, of course. There are many libraries, third-party APIs, and other modules that one has to talk to, but this does not mean that our business logic has to know the details of such things.</p><h3>Plug in an Adapter</h3><p>The adapter pattern simply creates a correspondence between the business logic and something else. We have already seen such a pattern in action: the gateway pattern.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You need to create a connection with a pre-existing and potentially changing module, library, or API.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To allow your business logic to rely only on the public methods the adapter offers, and permit changing the other side of the adapter easily.</p></div><p>If either of the above patterns don&#8217;t fit with your situation, then you could use&#8230;</p><h3>The Bridge Pattern</h3><p>This is a very complicated pattern. I personally do not like it because it is usually easier to take a different approach. But for those special cases, when other solutions fail, you can consider the bridge pattern.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> The adapter pattern is not enough, and you change classes on both sides of the pipe.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To offer increased flexibility at the cost of significant complexity.</p></div><hr
/><h2>The Composite Pattern</h2><p>Consider that you have a script with similar commands, and you want make a single call to run them. Wait! Didn&#8217;t we already see something like this earlier? The active object pattern?</p><p>Yes, yes we did. But this one is a bit different. It&#8217;s the composite pattern, and like the active object pattern, it keeps a list of objects. But calling a method on a composite object calls the same method on all of its objects without removing them from the list. The clients calling a method are thinking they are talking to a single object of that particular type, but in fact, their actions are applied to many, many objects of the same type.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You have to apply an action to several similar objects.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To reduce duplication and simplify how similar objects are called.</p></div><p>Here&#8217;s an example: you have an application that is capable of creating and placing <code>Orders</code>. Assume you have three orders: <code>$order1</code>, <code>$order2</code> and <code>$order3</code>. You could call <code>place()</code> on each of them, or you could contain those orders in a <code>$compositeOrder</code> object, and call its <code>place()</code> method. This, in turn, calls the <code>place()</code> method on all the contained <code>Order</code> objects.</p><hr
/><h2>The State Pattern</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Gateways only retrieve and persist raw data.</p></blockquote><p>A finite state machine (FSM) is a model that has a finite number of discreet states. Implementing a FSM can be difficult, and the easiest way to do so involves the trusty <code>switch</code> statement. Each <code>case</code> statement represents a current state in the machine, and it knows how to activate the next state.</p><p>But we all know that <code>switch...case</code> statements are less desirable because they produce an unwanted high fan-out on our objects. So forget the <code>switch...case</code> statement, and instead consider the state pattern. The state pattern is composed of several objects: an object to coordinate things, an interface representing an abstract state, and then several implementations &#8211; one for each state. Each state knows which state comes after it, and the state can notify the coordinating object to set its new state to the next in line.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> FSM-like logic is required to be implemented.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To eliminate the problems of a <code>switch...case</code> statement, and to better encapsulate the meaning of each individual state.</p></div><p>A food dispenser could have a <code>main</code> class that has a reference to a <code>state</code> class. Possible state classes might be something like: <code>WaitingForCoin</code>, <code>InsertedCoin</code>, <code>SelectedProduct</code>, <code>WaitingForConfirmation</code>, <code>DeliveringProduct</code>, <code>ReturningChange</code>. Each state performs its job and creates the next state object to send to the coordinator class.</p><hr
/><h2>Decorate with the Decorator Pattern</h2><p>There are times when you deploy classes or modules throughout an application, and you can&#8217;t modify them without radically affecting the system. But, at the same time, you need to add new functionality that your users require.</p><p>The decorator pattern can aid in these situations. It is very simple: take existing functionality and add to it. This is accomplished by extending the original class and providing new functionality at run-time. Old clients continue to use the new object as they would an old one, and new clients will use both the old and new functionality.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> You can&#8217;t change old classes, but you have to implement new behavior or state.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It offers an unintrusive way of adding new functionality.</p></div><p>A simple example is printing data. You print some information to the user as plain text, but you also want to provide the ability to print in HTML. The decorator pattern is one such solution that lets you keep both functionality.</p><h3>Or, Accept a Visitor</h3><p>If your problem of extending functionality is different &#8211; say, you have a complex tree-like structure of objects, and you want to add functionality to many nodes at once &#8211; a simple iteration is not possible, but a visitor might be a viable solution. The downside, however, is that a visitor pattern implementation requires modification to the old class if it wasn&#8217;t designed to accept a visitor.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>When:</strong> A decorator is not appropriate and some extra complexity is acceptable.</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> To allow and organized approach to defining functionality for several objects but at the price of higher complexity.</p></div><hr
/><h2>Conclusion</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Use design patterns to solve your problems, but only if they fit.</p></blockquote><p>Design patterns help solve problems. As an implementation recommendation, never name your classes after the patterns. Instead, find the right names for the right abstractions. This helps you to better discern when you really need a pattern as opposed to just implementing one because you can.</p><p>Some may say that if you don&#8217;t name your class with the pattern&#8217;s name in it, then other developers will have a difficult time understanding your code. If it&#8217;s hard to recognize a pattern, then the problem is in the pattern&#8217;s implementation.</p><p>Use design patterns to solve your problems, but only if they fit. Do not abuse them. You&#8217;ll find that a more simple solution befits a little problem; whereas, you&#8217;ll discover that you need a pattern only after you implement a few other solutions.</p><p>If you&#8217;re new to design patterns, I hope that this article has given you some idea as to how patterns can be helpful in your applications.

/><h2>Version Control</h2><p>Git has won; hands down. And there&#8217;s a plethora of tools available; some are great and some feel overly-complicated.</p><ul><li><a
href="http://git-scm.com/">Git (command line)</a> &#8211; Call me old school but I really like using Git via the command line.</li><li><a
href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a> &#8211; With that said, Github&#8217;s Windows client is really slick and makes it easy to use Git and their services via an attractive user interface.</li></ul><hr
/><h2>Virtualization</h2><p>Even on Windows, I still need to use VMs for non-modern versions of IE, and while I wish I could test these different versions side-by-side, at least I know I can spin up VM instances and workaround this. Here&#8217;s the software I use:</p><ul><li><a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> &#8211; Easy to use, supports every major OS and best of all, it&#8217;s free!</li><li><a
href="http://www.browserstack.com">BrowserStack.com</a> &#8211; If I need to see how my site will look like on another OS, I just spark up this great service and it creates a virtualized browser session in my own browser. It even supports local development so I can tunnel between my local dev and BrowserStack&#8217;s cloud servers.</li><li><a
href="http://www.modern.ie">modern.IE</a> &#8211; Microsoft is trying to lower the friction to testing IE and this project is a big step towards that. You can scan your site for common compat issues and download VMs for testing IE versions.</li></ul><div
class="tutorial_image"><img
src="http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/authors/jeremymcpeak/win-apps-virtualbox.png" /></div><hr
/><h2>VMs</h2><p>As I mentioned before, I use VMs for testing non-modern versions of IE. Thankfully, I don&#8217;t have to go grab the old VPC images which limited my options for VM software. I can now go to modern.IE and grab VMs for my platform.</p><ul><li><a
href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools">IE8 &amp; 9</a> &#8211; Available on modern.IE in a variety of target OSes and VM platforms.</li><li><a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu Server</a> &#8211; Pull down the iso for one of the most popular Linux distros and go.</li></ul><div
class="tutorial_image"><img
src="http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/authors/jeremymcpeak/win-apps-modernie.png" /></div><hr
/><h2>Screencasts</h2><p>Screencasts are one of the best ways of helping to teach developers. For Windows, the best option, in my opinion is <a
href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia Studio 8</a>. It&#8217;s makes creating, editing and producing screencasts trivial. I was up and running with it in an hour and TechSmith offers free tutorial videos to get you started quickly.</p><hr
/><h2>Screen Capture</h2><p>We&#8217;ve all been there. We want to do a quick screen grab but pressing &#8220;PrtScn&#8221;, and pasting into MS Paint is the suck. My choice for this is <a
href="http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html">Snagit</a>. It binds itself to the &#8220;PrtScn&#8221; key and allows you to easily choose which parts of the screen you want to grab. It can even do a full page scroll in a browser if the page is longer than the viewport. Once the grab is done, you have a full array of editing tools to tweak the image and post it. Solid tool.</p><hr
/><h2>Local Servers</h2><p>Web developers need web servers, and because I work with both MS and non-MS web developers, I like to have the option of switching between <a
href="http://www.iis.net/">IIS</a> (which a local version comes built into Windows) and <a
href="http://www.wampserver.com/">WampServer</a> which makes working with Apache, MySQL &amp; PHP so easy.</p><div
class="tutorial_image"><img
src="http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/authors/jeremymcpeak/win-apps-wamp.png" /></div><p>I also have <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> installed but I haven&#8217;t jumped into it yet. It&#8217;s definitely on my radar and a must-have since so many tools (like Grunt) are building on it.</p><hr
/><h2>Communication</h2><p>I&#8217;m a remote worker, so staying in contact is vital to me. I try to use as many tools as possible to be able to communicate with my co-workers and peers in the community. Here&#8217;s what I use:</p><ul><li><a
href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> &#8211; Not sure if there&#8217;s any other calling service that works as well as Skype. For voice and video, I don&#8217;t know of any better.</li><li><a
href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> &#8211; This open source IM client is great and easy to setup.</li><li><a
href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s interesting to see IRC picking up again after IM was the choice of chatter for so long. XChat has served me well in this space</li></ul><hr
/><h2>Command Line</h2><p>My *nix brethren tell me how they spend their lives in the terminal. I can&#8217;t say I do the same, but when I do, I choose <a
href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx">Windows PowerShell</a>. Personally, it&#8217;s just a &#8220;feel&#8221; thing since the way you work in it (e.g.: accessing directories) reminds me of *nix-based terminals. I&#8217;m definitely not takng full advantage of its features, but I do like it.</p><hr
/><h2>FTP</h2><p>For my FTP needs, I&#8217;ve not found anything that replaces <a
href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>. It&#8217;s open-source and jammed to the rim with the features I want. It would be nice if it had AWS support, but other than that, it&#8217;s a favorite of mine.</p><div
class="tutorial_image"><img
src="http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/authors/jeremymcpeak/win-apps-filezilla.png" /></div><hr
/><h2>HTTP Web Debugging Proxies</h2><p>I wrote about <a
href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-web-debugging-proxies/">web debugging proxies</a> recently, explaining the real benefits of using a third party traffic analyzer to inspect your HTTP requests. These are must-have tools, no matter which OS you work on.</p><ul><li><a
href="http://www.fiddler2.com">Fiddler</a> &#8211; In my opinion this is the best proxy for Windows. So many features and you can get a 300+ page book to boot that tells you EVERYTHING you need to know about using it.</li><li><a
href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a> &#8211; A VERY close second and it&#8217;s cross-platform to boot. This is my choice for OSX and Linux. If you want a consistent UI across all OSes, this is the one to choose.</li></ul><div
class="tutorial_image"><img
src="http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/authors/jeremymcpeak/win-apps-fiddler.png" /></div><hr
/><h2>TCP/IP</h2><p>Can you believe that Windows devs sometimes have to telnet or SSH into servers? Yeah it happens because not only do we work in Windows, but many of us support *nix systems and users. Go figure. <a
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/">Putty</a> is the way to go for this, and it&#8217;s free as well.</p><hr
/><h2>Online Storage</h2><p>The following aren&#8217;t necessarily apps, but these online storage services are useful for sharing code with peers:</p><ul><li><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a></li><li><a
href="https://skydrive.live.com/">SkyDrive</a></li><li><a
href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a></li><li><a
href="https://www.box.com/">Box.com</a></li><li><a
href="https://mega.co.nz/">Mega</a></li></ul><p>I&#8217;ve also heard about a new service by Carbonite called <a
href="http://labs.carbonite.com/">Currents</a>, which allows you to keep folders and files in sync. I&#8217;m considering Currents for keeping my desktop and laptops in sync.</p><hr
/><h2>More?</h2><p>This is a pretty big list and as I was writing it I was floored by the number of apps I regularly use, but I&#8217;m even more curious about the number of apps I haven&#8217;t heard of yet. I hope this list helps some of you, and I also hope you contribute in the comments. I want to learn about cool new tools.</p><div class="feedflare">

/><h2>Writing Code</h2><h3>Visual Studio 2012</h3><p>I <a
href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/visual-studio-web-dev-bliss/">wrote about Visual Studio</a> before, and I think it&#8217;s an awesome IDE. It&#8217;s feature-rich with tons of bells and whistles.</p><h3>Web Essential Extension for VS2012</h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Thank goodness browser-based debugging tools have evolved to what they are today.</p></blockquote><p>This is the <a

It brings functionality that web developers need such as:</p><ul><li>Bundling of files for future processing</li><li>Minification of assets</li><li>JSHint support for linting of your JavaScript code</li><li>Top client-side templating engines including Handlebars, Mustache and JSRender</li><li>The LESS stylesheet language with on-the-fly previewing</li><li>CoffeeScript and TypeScript</li></ul><p><a
href="http://madskristensen.net/">Mads Kristensen</a>, the creator of the extension, is a rockstar!</p><h3>Sublime Text 2</h3><p>It&#8217;s the little editor that can.

I also like to stay on top of new features that&#8217;ll be coming out shortly, and I also install dev and nightly browser builds to stay in the loop. Here&#8217;s the list of the browsers I use for testing:</p><ul><li><a

/><h2>Communication</h2><p>I&#8217;m a remote worker, so staying in contact is vital to me. I try to use as many tools as possible to be able to communicate with my co-workers and peers in the community. Here&#8217;s what I use:</p><ul><li><a
href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> &#8211; Not sure if there&#8217;s any other calling service that works as well as Skype. For voice and video, I don&#8217;t know of any better.</li><li><a

href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s interesting to see IRC picking up again after IM was the choice of chatter for so long. XChat has served me well in this space</li></ul><hr
/><h2>Command Line</h2><p>My *nix brethren tell me how they spend their lives in the terminal. I can&#8217;t say I do the same, but when I do, I choose <a
href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx">Windows PowerShell</a>. Personally, it&#8217;s just a &#8220;feel&#8221; thing since the way you work in it (e.g.: accessing directories) reminds me of *nix-based terminals. I&#8217;m definitely not takng full advantage of its features, but I do like it.</p><hr
/><h2>FTP</h2><p>For my FTP needs, I&#8217;ve not found anything that replaces <a
href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>. It&#8217;s open-source and jammed to the rim with the features I want. It would be nice if it had AWS support, but other than that, it&#8217;s a favorite of mine.</p><div

All sites use a similar DOM skeleton, as well as many common features and attributes. <a
href="http://volojs.org/">Volo</a> aims to remove some of the effort out of the process, allowing developers to focus on the new aspects of a project, as apposed to the same.</p><p><span
id="more-30465"></span></p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>If you add a JavaScript file that isn?t AMD compatible, Volo will try and convert it for you.</p></blockquote><p>Volo is an application that aids front-end developers by automating their processes. It lets you create projects based on a template; you can extend these templates and setup custom commands for automating repetitive tasks.</p><p>Volo was created with a very special relationship to GitHub; it understands GIT repos, as well as branches and tags. There is no special Volo package or repository; if something is on GitHub, you can use it in your project. This is what sets Volo apart from similar applications.</p><p>Volo was created by <a
href="http://jrburke.com/" alt="James Burke">James Burke</a>, the same James Burke that created the very popular <a
href="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a> library.</p><blockquote><p>It may not surprise you that Volo has a very opinionated workflow; it assumes you want to use proper AMD for files, as well as providing presets on where to put files.</p></blockquote><p>Is this a bad thing? Not really&#8211;you should be doing this anyway. Besides, you can override the commands if you need to do so.</p><p>So let&#8217;s begin by going through some of Volo&#8217;s commands.</p><hr
/><h2>Creating Projects</h2><p>You&#8217;ll probably use the <code>create</code> command first. I mentioned that Volo is deeply rooted in GitHub, but interestingly enough, Volo doesn&#8217;t actually use GIT. You usually just want a snapshot of a repo, not its entire commit history; so Volo only downloads the repo&#8217;s files without the actual GIT data.</p><p>The simplest method of referencing a template is to just provide the repo&#8217;s name. For example, if you want to copy a repo named &#8216;starterTemplate&#8217;, you can simply type the following command:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo create myApp starterTemplate</pre><p>Assuming the repo is the first result returned by GitHub, Volo will download and &#8220;install&#8221; the template to a new directory called <code>myApp</code>.</p><p>This is a little risky, especially if you prefer to name your repos with very generic titles. Thankfully, you can specify more details to narrow the result set. The filtering system is fairly advanced when it comes to deciphering your input. Basically, you can use:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo create appName userName/repoName/[branch|tag]</pre><p>You can also omit certain pieces of information. For example, you can omit the GitHub user name, causing Volo to search for the first project with the given name and branch.</p><blockquote><p>Alternatively, you can specify the user name but omit the version/branch, and Volo will download the latest tagged version.</p></blockquote><p>If no tags are found, Volo falls back to the master branch.</p><p>Furthermore, you&#8217;re not required to specify an exact version. Typing an expression like &#8220;<code>&gt;1.0</code>&#8221; tells Volo to download a version greater than 1.0.</p><p>Last but not least, you don&#8217;t have to use a repo from Github; you simply pass the URL to the zip archive you want to use as your template. To copy a local folder, you can use the following format:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">local:/path/to/directory</pre><p>So there are a variety of options you can use to select your desired repo, and you can even omit the repo name to use Volo&#8217;s own <a
href="https://github.com/volojs/create-template" alt="default template">default template</a>.</p><hr
/><h2>Searching and Retrieving Repo Information</h2><p>Unsure who the owner of a popular repo is? Use the <code>search</code> command.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo search repoName</pre><p>It uses the same GitHub search as <code>create</code>; so you can be sure that the first repo in your search results is the repo Volo will download.</p><p>The <code>search</code> command is only for finding a repo or retrieving its information. As a result, it lacks some of the functionality found in the <code>create</code> command. For example, James created a few official templates that you can use, but you may not know their names.</p><blockquote><p>Executing <code>volo search volojs/template</code> displays a few good options to use.</p></blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t have to be too accurate with your search criteria; Volo does a decent job finding what you want. It&#8217;s surprisingly fast.</p><p>If you want more infoformation about a repo, such as version numbers or links, you can use the appropriately named <code>info</code> command. One of the results from <code>volo search volojs/template</code> is a repo named &#8216;volojs/create-responsive-template&#8217;. You can retrieve more information about this repo by typing:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo info volojs/create-responsive-template</pre><p>Using the <code>create</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>info</code> commands, we can assume that we created our app. So what&#8217;s next?</p><hr
/><h2>Adding Files</h2><p>Next, we need to add dependencies. This is fairly easy, and it uses the same options as the <code>create</code> command with a few additions. Besides being able to specify a GitHub user, branch/tag or URL to a zip, the <code>add</code> command lets you append &#8220;<code>#&lt;filename&gt;</code>&#8221; to intall a specific file from the repo. Many repos tend to have the JaveScript library that you want, but it is packaged together with demos and documentation. More often than not, you want just the library, and the <code>add</code> command lets you do this.</p><p>Let&#8217;s pretend you want to download a library called &#8216;foo.js&#8217;. You can simply type:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add user/fooRepo/v1.5#foo.js</pre><p>This downloads the entire zip file from GitHub, extracts only the <code>foo.js</code> file and adds it to your project. This hashtag feature is not specific to filenames; you can pass a folder name to add only the specified folder to your project.</p><p>Earlier I mentioned that Volo expects you to practice proper AMD. So if you add a JavaScript file that isn&#8217;t AMD compatible, Volo will try and convert it for you. The process is pretty simple.</p><blockquote><p>It begins by asking what dependencies your JavaScript file uses.</p></blockquote><p>You can either pass the dependecies&#8217; names in a comma separated list, or you can optionally give them a variable name. Here is an example of what you may type for a jQuery plugin:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
jquery1.9=jQuery,jqueryui
</pre><p>This tells Volo that the specified library requires the file named <code>jquery1.9</code> and to pass it under the variable name <code>jQuery</code>. Then we add a comma to declare the next dependency: <code>jqueryui</code>.</p><p>After you finish declaring your dependencies, you can declare what you want to export from your script. You don&#8217;t usually export anything in a jQuery plugin; that&#8217;s handled by jQuery itself. But if you have a JavaScript library that does need to export something, you would just type the name of the desired variable in your script. You can use this conversion feature on the fly with the <code>amdify</code> command:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo amdify &lt;filename&gt;</pre><p>Just pass the desired filename.</p><p>You can also automatically rename a downloaded file. For example, you may want to add a file named <code>jquery.pluginName.1.3.min.js</code>, but it&#8217;s not a convenient file to reference in your scripts. You can pass a new name as the final parameter to the <code>add</code> command, and Volo will rename the file.</p><p>To sum up, we can install this pseudo jQuery plugin from within a repo by typing the following:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add userName/RepoName/v1.3#jquery.pluginName.1.3.min.js newName.js</pre><p>Volo will download the specified repo, extract only the given file for the plugin, ask you how to convert it to be AMD compliant and place it in your project under the new name. It&#8217;s a lot of control and automation in a very easy to use command.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s move on to Volofiles.</p><hr
/><h2>Volofiles</h2><p>Volofiles allow you to automate tasks by creating macro-like commands. For example, CoffeeScript and SCSS users may manually issue the following commands to compile their files:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">coffee -c coffee-lib/ -o lib/
coffee -c app.coffee
sass css/main.scss css/main.css</pre><p>This is a lot of commands to repeatedly execute. Naturally, one can add these commands to a bash file, but automating multiple operations more than likely involves a semi-complicated bash file or multiple bash files. With Volo, you create a file named <code>volofile</code>. Inside this file, you create a JavaScript object that contains the commands you want to execute. Then you can simply call the them as if they were native commands.</p><p>Here is a sample <code>volofile</code> using common parameters:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">module.exports = {
	'hi': {
		'summary' : 'A command to say Hello',

		'doc' : 'Enter Doc Text Here or Load a file',

		'validate' : function(namedArgs, arg1){
			if(namedArgs.cancel == &quot;true&quot;){
				return new Error('The &quot;cancel&quot; parameter has been set');
			}
		},

		'run' : [
			'echo &quot;Hello World&quot;',
			'echo &quot;How are you Today?&quot;'
		]
	},
	'nextCommand' : {
		?
	}
}</pre><p>You could then type <code>volo -h</code> to view these commands and their summary. Entering <code>volo hi -h</code> shows whatever is in the <code>doc</code> field. The <code>validate</code> key is optional, and you can use it for testing purposes to optionally exit if there is a problem. Last but not least, we have the <code>run</code> property, which contains the list of command to execute. You can enter a simple string or an array of strings, and Volo will process and run each one accordingly.</p><p>With the above command, I would be able to type:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo hi</pre><p>To get the output, or:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo hi cancel=true</pre><p>To trigger the <code>if</code> statement and exit with the provided error message. This is probably the most basic of examples, and you have many more options available when creating your own commands.</p><p>I mentioned Volo processes each string in the <code>run</code> property. The above sample uses the &#8216;last-resort&#8217; setting. Volo first looks for certain characteristics in your commands, and it only executes the string in the standard terminal if it cannot determine what you want. You have two options before that though, and they are named &#8216;<code>v</code>&#8216; and &#8216;<code>n</code>&#8216;.</p><h3>The &#8216;<code>v</code>&#8216; and &#8216;<code>n</code>&#8216; Keywords</h3><p>These two keywords allow you to inject custom functionality into your run strings. If you need to read files, execute processes, or other OS-specific tasks, you want to use the &#8216;<code>v</code>&#8216; keyword. Just writing the command (e.g. <code>rm file.js</code>) only works on operating systems that support the given command. By using <code>v</code>&#8216;s commands, you assure cross-platform support of your <code>volofile</code>. For example, you can add the following run string if you want to copy a file from one location to another:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">run : 'v.copyFile file_one file_two'</pre><p>This command is cross-platform. To see the full list of &#8216;<code>v</code>&#8216; options, take a look at the <a
href="https://github.com/volojs/volo/blob/master/lib/v.js#L42" alt="V options">source file</a>. You can add parameters with a space (like in the terminal) instead of using brackets.</p><p>Next we have the <code>n</code> keyword, which maps to executable node.js modules. If you specify a command under the <code>n</code> keyword, Volo checks if it can find the node.js executable in the current project&#8217;s private <code>node_modules</code> folder, and it falls back to the global node.js modules folder if one is not found.</p><blockquote><p>Node.js, or more specifically NPM, has a very large collection of quality development tools created by many smart and creative people.</p></blockquote><p>Volo leverages that enormous resource by allowing you to plugin their executables right into your Volofiles. James Burke has even created a template for creating your own node.js modules specifically for Volo, but we will get to that in a minute.</p><p>An example of using the <code>n</code> keyword is the CoffeeScript module. If you want to compile a directory containing CoffeeScript files, we could write the following command:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">'run' : 'n.coffee -c coffee-lib/ -o lib/'</pre><p>Even if CoffeeScript isn&#8217;t globally installed, you can ensure it will run on all OSs from the local <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p><p>Now you can use the command template I mentioned (<a
href="https://github.com/volojs/create-command-template" alt="Command Template">download here</a>, by the way) to create a reusable Volo command to use in all your projects. For example, if you have a module that backs up your app, you may want to include it in all your projects.</p><blockquote><p>Create a standard NPM module that exports the aforementioned properties (<code>summary</code>, <code>run</code> etc) and require the module into your Volofile.</p></blockquote><p>So, with your package added to NPM, you can just type:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">npm install commandName</pre><p>And in your volofile, just type:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">module.exports = {
    'commandName': require('node_modules/commandName/index')
};</pre><p>Where <code>index.js</code> is the name of your extension. Because your file exports the necessary properties, the options will be directly injected into your volofile under the given command name. I wouldn&#8217;t really call it a custom feature (it&#8217;s standard JavaScript), but it&#8217;s still nice to know you have this option.</p><p>Now with the theory out of the way, let&#8217;s look into a real-world example. We&#8217;ll build an app using Volo.</p><hr
/><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Volo is a NPM package, so installing it is as simple as:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">(sudo) npm install -g volo</pre><p>For this article, I thought I would create a small web page for generating a map of your area, showing who the FourSquare mayors of your favorite sites. It&#8217;s not an incredible deep idea, but it will put Volo through the paces.</p><p>So to begin, we need a repo. You can find a number of starter templates, created specifically for Volo, by simply searching GitHub. The default template comes with the bare necessities: a simple HTML skeleton and a JavaScript folder with an AMD barebones setup.</p><blockquote><p>You also get a volofile with a build command for compiling the project&#8217;s JavaScript and CSS files.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not going to use the standard template, as I would like to have a few more resources. After a quick GitHub search, I found <a
href="https://github.com/volojs/create-responsive-template" alt="Responsive Template">an official template</a> that contains the defaults, the bootstrap framework, and other resources.</p><p>So to create our new project (which I named &#8216;turf&#8217;), you can simply type the following in a terminal window:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo create turf volojs/create-responsive-template
cd turf</pre><p>This creates the project folder and downloads a snapshot of the specified repo. Next, to download other resources. We will obviously use jQuery, so let&#8217;s add it:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add jquery</pre><p>We also need a way to display a map on the page. Google Maps comes to mind, so we&#8217;ll use a library named <a
href="https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps">gmaps</a>. The JavaScript file contains the entire library; therefore, we don&#8217;t really need the rest of the repo. Additionally, you can see that the library is stored within a variable named <code>GMaps</code>, and it requires the Google maps API as a dependency.</p><blockquote><p>There is one small problem with this: the Google Maps API is not AMD compliant and is an asynchronous library.</p></blockquote><p>When you load the single URL, it continues to load other resources on its own. This makes using standard require.js a problem, but there&#8217;s a plugin that handles this exact situation. It&#8217;s part of a repo called &#8220;requirejs-plugins&#8221;, but once again, we don&#8217;t need the entire repo. So, type the following in the terminal window:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add requirejs-plugins#src/async.js</pre><p>With the async plugin, we can load our special asynchronous dependencies.</p><p>We have two options to install the actual plugin:</p><ul><li>Convert the library to be AMD-compliant.</li><li>Use require.js&#8217; shim feature for adding non-AMD files.</li></ul><p>I&#8217;ll show you how to use both options. To convert the file, just add it. Volo will automatically detect that the file needs to be converted:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add HPNeo/gmaps#gmaps.js</pre><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Volo was created with a very special relationship to GitHub; it understands GIT repos, as well as branches and tags.</p></blockquote><p>According to the project&#8217;s Github page, it relies on the google maps API. There is a small issue with entering the URL because it contains unsupported characters (the equals sign). So let&#8217;s use a placeholder; just type <code>googlemaps</code> and hit enter. Next, we need to specify what we want to export. Type <code>GMaps</code> (with the two capital letters; that&#8217;s the name of the variable) and hit enter. Volo will finish converting it and add it to the <code>js/lib</code> folder.</p><p>Why the <code>js/lib</code> folder? If you take a look at the <code>package.json</code> file in the root of your project, you will see an entry called <code>baseUrl</code> under the <code>amd</code> property. This tells Volo where to put all downloaded JavaScript files. There is actually a number of locations Volo looks in to decide where to put stuff:</p><ol><li><code>baseDir</code> property under an entry named <code>volo</code></li><li><code>baseUrl</code> property again under <code>volo</code></li><li><code>baseUrl</code> under <code>amd</code> like we have here</li><li>a <code>js</code> folder in your current directory</li><li>a <code>scripts</code> folder in your current directory</li></ol><p>If none of these locations exist, Volo puts the file in the current directory.</p><p>With the module installed, we still need to replace the placeholder we created for the Google Maps API. Open the <code>www/js/lib/gmaps.js</code> file and replace the placeholder in the first (or second) line with the following:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">async!http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&amp;amp;libraries=places</pre><p>This tells Volo to include the async plugin and pass it the URL for the Google Maps API.</p><p>The GMaps module is now fully installed, but it requires you to enter specific longitude and latitude coordinates&#8211;something most users will not know. So we should have some kind of autocomplete plugin that converts location names to coordinates.</p><p>After another quick Github search, I found a jQuery plugin called <a
href="https://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete" alt="geocomplete">geocomplete</a> by ubilabs. It too is not AMD compliant, but we will use require.js&#8217; shim feature. In the terminal type the following command:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add -amdoff ubilabs/geocomplete#jquery.geocomplete.js geocomplete</pre><p>The <code>amdoff</code> option prevents Volo from converting the file, and the ending parameter renames the file from <code>jquery.geocomplete.js</code> to <code>geocomplete.js</code>. This is not mandatory, but it makes referencing it more convenient.</p><p>Now open the <code>www/js/app.js</code> file, and replace the require.js config declaration at the top:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">requirejs.config({
    baseUrl: 'js/lib',
    paths: {
        app: '../app'
    },
    shim: {
        'geocomplete' : {
            deps: ['jquery', 'async!http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&amp;amp;libraries=places']
        }
    }
});</pre><p>Just to run through the settings that were already there, <code>baseUrl</code> tells require.js where to look for relative files, and the <code>paths.app</code> option tells require.js that if a module name has a reference to a location named &#8220;app&#8221;, then to replace with what is specified (&#8216;../app&#8217;).</p><p>The <code>shim</code> section is what I added to the file. It tells require.js to first load jQuery and the Google Maps API when someone loads a file named <code>geocomplete</code>. You could optionally set another property called <code>exports</code>, the name of the variable to export. We don&#8217;t need to export anything because this is a plugin and it attaches to the jQuery object.</p><p>At this point, we have the files necessary to display the map and retrieve the necessary coordinates. We haven&#8217;t written any code, but we do have all the dependencies.</p><hr
/><h2>The Outline</h2><p>To begin prototyping our app, we need to write some HTML. Open up the <code>index.html</code> file and remove everything inside the body tags except the <code>&lt;script /&gt;</code> element at the bottom. You should be left with a file like the following:</p><pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;css/app.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script async data-main=&quot;js/app&quot; src=&quot;js/lib/require.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>Next, add a text input field for the search box and a placeholder for the actual map. Your new body area should look something like this:</p><pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;span8 offset2&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;row text-center&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;input class=&quot;input-xxlarge&quot; id=&quot;search&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;row text-center&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div id=&quot;map&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script async data-main=&quot;js/app&quot; src=&quot;js/lib/require.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre><p>It&#8217;s a little more than the basics so that it conforms to bootstrap&#8217;s CSS rules. I gave the text input an ID of <code>search</code> and the map&#8217;s <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> an ID of <code>map</code>. Now let&#8217;s open the JavaScript file.</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Volo is an application that aids front-end developers by automating their processes.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll break it down for those of you who are new to require.js. The primary reason to use something like require.js is to make sure your scripts&#8217; dependencies are loaded when, and only when, your script actually needs them. This increases the overall speed of your site and simplifies your HTML files (you don&#8217;t need reference many scripts).</p><p>You can see the script at the bottom of the HTML file points to the require.js library, and it also has a <code>data-main</code> attribute that automatically runs once require.js is ready.</p><p>If you open <code>js/app.js</code>, our modified config section and a require statement at the bottom. Notice that you don&#8217;t need the file extension. In the index file, we referenced <code>js/app</code> (without the <code>.js</code>), and here load <code>app/main</code>.</p><p>Normally, a reference to <code>app/main</code> would map to a file called <code>main.js</code> inside a folder called <code>app</code> (all relative to the <code>js/lib</code> folder). But remember in the config, we said any reference to a location called <code>app</code>, should be replaced with <code>../app</code>. Instead of searching for <code>js/lib/app/main.js</code>, require.js will retrieve <code>js/app/main.js</code>.</p><p>Next, open <code>js/app/main.js</code>, remove everything and type the following:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">define(['jquery', 'gmaps', 'geocomplete'], function ($, gmaps) {
    $(document).ready(function () {
         $(&quot;#search&quot;).geocomplete();
    });
});</pre><p>The first parameter is an array of our dependencies. The second is a function with parameter names for jQuery (<code>$</code>) and GMaps (<code>gmaps</code>). Remember that geocomplete is a jQuery plugin, so there&#8217;s no reason to give it a corresponding parameter..</p><blockquote><p>The function passed as the second parameter executes after the dependencies finish loading.</p></blockquote><p>Inside this function, we execute the <code>geocomplete()</code> method when the document is ready.</p><p>You can now open the page in your browser, and if all went well, the text box should say &#8220;Enter a Location&#8221;. Start typing, and you&#8217;ll see some results.</p><p>Next, we need to handle the event when a match is found, i.e. when the user presses the Enter key on a place&#8217;s name. These events are: <code>geocode:result</code> and the <code>geocode:error</code>. Add the code to handle these events:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">$(document).ready(function () {
    $(&quot;#search&quot;).geocomplete()
    .bind(&quot;geocode:result&quot;, function(event, result){
        //On Result
    })
    .bind(&quot;geocode:error&quot;, function(event, result){
         alert(&quot;Location not Found&quot;);
    });
});</pre><p>The next step is to retrieve the latitude and longitude and generate a new map. The lat/long are stored in properties named <code>geometry.location.hb</code> and <code>geometry.location.ib</code>, respectively. Add the following code inside the <code>geocode:result</code> handler:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">var lat = result.geometry.location.hb;
var lng = result.geometry.location.ib;

var map = new gmaps({
    div : &quot;#map&quot;,
    lat : lat,
    lng : lng,
    height : '380px' 
});</pre><p>We store the coordinates and load a new map. Creaing a map is simple: we pass the container&#8217;s ID along with the coordinates and height.</p><p>You should now be able to search and display a map. Next, we need to interface with Foursquare and display the &#8220;mayors&#8221; of your city.</p><hr
/><h2>Interfacing with Foursquare</h2><p>We first need an interface to the foursquare API. To save time, and to stay on topic, I created a repo that we can clone. So in the terminal window, type:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">git clone https://github.com/gmanricks/MayorAPI www/foursquare</pre><p>This downloads the repo and places it in a folder named <code>foursquare</code> under the <code>www</code> directory.</p><p>Next, open <code>foursquare.php</code> and insert your client-id and client-secret into the class&#8217; constants. If you don&#8217;t already have this information, you can get it from <a
href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> by registering an app.</p><p>The other file in the repo (<code>data.php</code>) retrieves the map coordinates via GET parameters and returns a JSON object. So to add the mayors to the map, we need to rewrite the <code>geocomplete:result</code> event handler:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">.bind(&quot;geocode:result&quot;, function(event, result){
    var lat = result.geometry.location.hb;
    var lng = result.geometry.location.ib;
    $.get(&quot;foursquare/data.php?lat=&quot; + lat + &quot;&amp;lng=&quot; + lng, function(d){
        var map = new gmaps({
            div : &quot;#map&quot;,
            lat : lat,
            lng : lng,
            height : '380px' 
        });
        var places = JSON.parse(d);
        if(places.error){
            alert(&quot;The rate limit has been hit&quot;);
        }
        else{
            for (var index in places) {
                var place = places[index];
                if(place.mayor.photo){
                    var html = '&lt;div class=&quot;mayor&quot;&gt;'
                             +     '&lt;div class=&quot;person&quot;&gt;'
                             +         '&lt;img class=&quot;img-circle img-polaroid&quot; src=&quot;'
                             +               place.mayor.photo.prefix + &quot;60x60&quot; + place.mayor.photo.suffix 
                             +           '&quot; /&gt;' 
                             +     '&lt;/div&gt;'
                             +     '&lt;div class=&quot;label label-inverse&quot;&gt;' + place.mayor.name + '&lt;/div&gt;'
                             + '&lt;/div&gt;';
                    map.drawOverlay({
                        lat : place.lat,
                        lng : place.lng,
                        content : html
                    });
                }
            }
        }
    });
})</pre><p>We first define the <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code> variables, but instead of immediately creating the map, we wait for our Ajax request to complete. We&#8217;re making about eleven API calls behind the scenes, so it might take ten or fifteen seconds.</p><p>Next, we make sure the rate limit hasn&#8217;t been hit and alert the user appropriately. Finally, we cycle through the results, adding each one to the map using a command from the GMaps library.</p><p>You can now open the page and test it out; everything should work! With a little styling and some design, it could look something like this:</p><div

/><h2>Optimizing with Volo</h2><p>Our app is complete, and the last step is to optimize it. Let&#8217;s first delete the files we do not use. In the <code>js/app/</code> folder, you can remove everything but the <code>main.js</code> file. In the <code>js/lib/</code> folder, remove the files named <code>appCache.js</code> and <code>network.js</code>. You also don&#8217;t need the <code>manifest.webapp</code> file, but you could keep if you so desire.</p><p>Now open the <code>volofile</code>, and you can see that the template came with a pretty complicated build command for optimizing and setting up the project&#8217;s JavaScript and CSS files. We don&#8217;t need such an elaborate script, so delete everything from the file and replace it with the following:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">module.exports = {
    'build' : {
        'summary' : 'Command to compile the source files',
        'run' : [
            'v.rm www-built',
            'v.copyDir www www-built',
            'v.rm www-built/js',
            'node tools/r.js -o baseUrl=www/js/lib paths.app=../app paths.requireLib=require name=app include=requireLib out=www-built/js/lib/require.js',
            'v.rm www-built/css',
            'node tools/r.js -o cssIn=www/css/app.css out=www-built/css/app.css'
        ]
    }
};</pre><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Volo is an omni-tool: you get what you put into it.</p></blockquote><p>This is much more simple. Here, we create a command named <code>build</code> that removes the previous built folde if it exists. It then copies the entire <code>www</code> folder as a base for our compiled version. Next, we delete the <code>js</code> directory (we&#8217;ll replace it with the optimized version).</p><p>Then we run require.js&#8217; optimizer to compile the JavaScript files into a single file. You may notice it renames the final product to <code>require.js</code>; this is kind of a &#8220;hack&#8221; because it&#8217;s not really the require.js library. But since our HTML file has a reference to <code>require.js</code> already, it&#8217;s easier to rename the Javascript file than to parsing all HTML files and change the script references.</p><p>Once that command completes, we remove the CSS folder (again to replace it with the optimized version). And last but not least, we run the require.js optimizer again, this time for the CSS.</p><p>You can now execute <code>volo build</code> from your terminal window and Volo will run this series of commands.</p><p>In your browser, you can navigate to the <code>www-built</code> folder instead of the <code>www</code> folder to make sure it still works. On my computer, building the project cut the file size in half, from just under a megabyte to ~400kb. You can probably get it even smaller if you minify the CSS.</p><hr
/><h2>Summary</h2><p>In this article, I taught you Volo&#8217;s syntax and we built an example application. We learned how to use Volo to create a project, add dependencies, add custom commands for automating common tasks and optimize an entire project.</p><p>To sum up, Volo is an omni-tool: you get what you put into it. You have a few, but powerful, commands, but Volo&#8217;s true power comes from it&#8217;s incredible extendibility and ultimately its community.</p><p>So what do you think about Volo? Will you be creating custom Volo commands? Leave a comment with your questions and opinions.</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p><div class="feedflare">

class="pullquote"><p>If you add a JavaScript file that isn?t AMD compatible, Volo will try and convert it for you.</p></blockquote><p>Volo is an application that aids front-end developers by automating their processes. It lets you create projects based on a template; you can extend these templates and setup custom commands for automating repetitive tasks.</p><p>Volo was created with a very special relationship to GitHub; it understands GIT repos, as well as branches and tags. There is no special Volo package or repository; if something is on GitHub, you can use it in your project. This is what sets Volo apart from similar applications.</p><p>Volo was created by <a
href="http://jrburke.com/" alt="James Burke">James Burke</a>, the same James Burke that created the very popular <a
href="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a> library.</p><blockquote><p>It may not surprise you that Volo has a very opinionated workflow; it assumes you want to use proper AMD for files, as well as providing presets on where to put files.</p></blockquote><p>Is this a bad thing? Not really&#8211;you should be doing this anyway. Besides, you can override the commands if you need to do so.</p><p>So let&#8217;s begin by going through some of Volo&#8217;s commands.</p><hr
/><h2>Creating Projects</h2><p>You&#8217;ll probably use the <code>create</code> command first. I mentioned that Volo is deeply rooted in GitHub, but interestingly enough, Volo doesn&#8217;t actually use GIT. You usually just want a snapshot of a repo, not its entire commit history; so Volo only downloads the repo&#8217;s files without the actual GIT data.</p><p>The simplest method of referencing a template is to just provide the repo&#8217;s name. For example, if you want to copy a repo named &#8216;starterTemplate&#8217;, you can simply type the following command:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo create myApp starterTemplate</pre><p>Assuming the repo is the first result returned by GitHub, Volo will download and &#8220;install&#8221; the template to a new directory called <code>myApp</code>.</p><p>This is a little risky, especially if you prefer to name your repos with very generic titles. Thankfully, you can specify more details to narrow the result set. The filtering system is fairly advanced when it comes to deciphering your input. Basically, you can use:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo create appName userName/repoName/[branch|tag]</pre><p>You can also omit certain pieces of information. For example, you can omit the GitHub user name, causing Volo to search for the first project with the given name and branch.</p><blockquote><p>Alternatively, you can specify the user name but omit the version/branch, and Volo will download the latest tagged version.</p></blockquote><p>If no tags are found, Volo falls back to the master branch.</p><p>Furthermore, you&#8217;re not required to specify an exact version. Typing an expression like &#8220;<code>&gt;1.0</code>&#8221; tells Volo to download a version greater than 1.0.</p><p>Last but not least, you don&#8217;t have to use a repo from Github; you simply pass the URL to the zip archive you want to use as your template. To copy a local folder, you can use the following format:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">local:/path/to/directory</pre><p>So there are a variety of options you can use to select your desired repo, and you can even omit the repo name to use Volo&#8217;s own <a
href="https://github.com/volojs/create-template" alt="default template">default template</a>.</p><hr
/><h2>Searching and Retrieving Repo Information</h2><p>Unsure who the owner of a popular repo is? Use the <code>search</code> command.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo search repoName</pre><p>It uses the same GitHub search as <code>create</code>; so you can be sure that the first repo in your search results is the repo Volo will download.</p><p>The <code>search</code> command is only for finding a repo or retrieving its information. As a result, it lacks some of the functionality found in the <code>create</code> command. For example, James created a few official templates that you can use, but you may not know their names.</p><blockquote><p>Executing <code>volo search volojs/template</code> displays a few good options to use.</p></blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t have to be too accurate with your search criteria; Volo does a decent job finding what you want. It&#8217;s surprisingly fast.</p><p>If you want more infoformation about a repo, such as version numbers or links, you can use the appropriately named <code>info</code> command. One of the results from <code>volo search volojs/template</code> is a repo named &#8216;volojs/create-responsive-template&#8217;. You can retrieve more information about this repo by typing:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo info volojs/create-responsive-template</pre><p>Using the <code>create</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>info</code> commands, we can assume that we created our app. So what&#8217;s next?</p><hr
/><h2>Adding Files</h2><p>Next, we need to add dependencies. This is fairly easy, and it uses the same options as the <code>create</code> command with a few additions. Besides being able to specify a GitHub user, branch/tag or URL to a zip, the <code>add</code> command lets you append &#8220;<code>#&lt;filename&gt;</code>&#8221; to intall a specific file from the repo. Many repos tend to have the JaveScript library that you want, but it is packaged together with demos and documentation. More often than not, you want just the library, and the <code>add</code> command lets you do this.</p><p>Let&#8217;s pretend you want to download a library called &#8216;foo.js&#8217;. You can simply type:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add user/fooRepo/v1.5#foo.js</pre><p>This downloads the entire zip file from GitHub, extracts only the <code>foo.js</code> file and adds it to your project. This hashtag feature is not specific to filenames; you can pass a folder name to add only the specified folder to your project.</p><p>Earlier I mentioned that Volo expects you to practice proper AMD. So if you add a JavaScript file that isn&#8217;t AMD compatible, Volo will try and convert it for you. The process is pretty simple.</p><blockquote><p>It begins by asking what dependencies your JavaScript file uses.</p></blockquote><p>You can either pass the dependecies&#8217; names in a comma separated list, or you can optionally give them a variable name. Here is an example of what you may type for a jQuery plugin:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
jquery1.9=jQuery,jqueryui
</pre><p>This tells Volo that the specified library requires the file named <code>jquery1.9</code> and to pass it under the variable name <code>jQuery</code>. Then we add a comma to declare the next dependency: <code>jqueryui</code>.</p><p>After you finish declaring your dependencies, you can declare what you want to export from your script. You don&#8217;t usually export anything in a jQuery plugin; that&#8217;s handled by jQuery itself. But if you have a JavaScript library that does need to export something, you would just type the name of the desired variable in your script. You can use this conversion feature on the fly with the <code>amdify</code> command:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo amdify &lt;filename&gt;</pre><p>Just pass the desired filename.</p><p>You can also automatically rename a downloaded file. For example, you may want to add a file named <code>jquery.pluginName.1.3.min.js</code>, but it&#8217;s not a convenient file to reference in your scripts. You can pass a new name as the final parameter to the <code>add</code> command, and Volo will rename the file.</p><p>To sum up, we can install this pseudo jQuery plugin from within a repo by typing the following:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add userName/RepoName/v1.3#jquery.pluginName.1.3.min.js newName.js</pre><p>Volo will download the specified repo, extract only the given file for the plugin, ask you how to convert it to be AMD compliant and place it in your project under the new name. It&#8217;s a lot of control and automation in a very easy to use command.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s move on to Volofiles.</p><hr
/><h2>Volofiles</h2><p>Volofiles allow you to automate tasks by creating macro-like commands. For example, CoffeeScript and SCSS users may manually issue the following commands to compile their files:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">coffee -c coffee-lib/ -o lib/
coffee -c app.coffee
sass css/main.scss css/main.css</pre><p>This is a lot of commands to repeatedly execute. Naturally, one can add these commands to a bash file, but automating multiple operations more than likely involves a semi-complicated bash file or multiple bash files. With Volo, you create a file named <code>volofile</code>. Inside this file, you create a JavaScript object that contains the commands you want to execute. Then you can simply call the them as if they were native commands.</p><p>Here is a sample <code>volofile</code> using common parameters:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">module.exports = {
	'hi': {
		'summary' : 'A command to say Hello',

		'doc' : 'Enter Doc Text Here or Load a file',

		'validate' : function(namedArgs, arg1){
			if(namedArgs.cancel == &quot;true&quot;){
				return new Error('The &quot;cancel&quot; parameter has been set');
			}
		},

		'run' : [
			'echo &quot;Hello World&quot;',
			'echo &quot;How are you Today?&quot;'
		]
	},
	'nextCommand' : {
		?
	}
}</pre><p>You could then type <code>volo -h</code> to view these commands and their summary. Entering <code>volo hi -h</code> shows whatever is in the <code>doc</code> field. The <code>validate</code> key is optional, and you can use it for testing purposes to optionally exit if there is a problem. Last but not least, we have the <code>run</code> property, which contains the list of command to execute. You can enter a simple string or an array of strings, and Volo will process and run each one accordingly.</p><p>With the above command, I would be able to type:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo hi</pre><p>To get the output, or:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo hi cancel=true</pre><p>To trigger the <code>if</code> statement and exit with the provided error message. This is probably the most basic of examples, and you have many more options available when creating your own commands.</p><p>I mentioned Volo processes each string in the <code>run</code> property. The above sample uses the &#8216;last-resort&#8217; setting. Volo first looks for certain characteristics in your commands, and it only executes the string in the standard terminal if it cannot determine what you want. You have two options before that though, and they are named &#8216;<code>v</code>&#8216; and &#8216;<code>n</code>&#8216;.</p><h3>The &#8216;<code>v</code>&#8216; and &#8216;<code>n</code>&#8216; Keywords</h3><p>These two keywords allow you to inject custom functionality into your run strings. If you need to read files, execute processes, or other OS-specific tasks, you want to use the &#8216;<code>v</code>&#8216; keyword. Just writing the command (e.g. <code>rm file.js</code>) only works on operating systems that support the given command. By using <code>v</code>&#8216;s commands, you assure cross-platform support of your <code>volofile</code>. For example, you can add the following run string if you want to copy a file from one location to another:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">run : 'v.copyFile file_one file_two'</pre><p>This command is cross-platform. To see the full list of &#8216;<code>v</code>&#8216; options, take a look at the <a
href="https://github.com/volojs/volo/blob/master/lib/v.js#L42" alt="V options">source file</a>. You can add parameters with a space (like in the terminal) instead of using brackets.</p><p>Next we have the <code>n</code> keyword, which maps to executable node.js modules. If you specify a command under the <code>n</code> keyword, Volo checks if it can find the node.js executable in the current project&#8217;s private <code>node_modules</code> folder, and it falls back to the global node.js modules folder if one is not found.</p><blockquote><p>Node.js, or more specifically NPM, has a very large collection of quality development tools created by many smart and creative people.</p></blockquote><p>Volo leverages that enormous resource by allowing you to plugin their executables right into your Volofiles. James Burke has even created a template for creating your own node.js modules specifically for Volo, but we will get to that in a minute.</p><p>An example of using the <code>n</code> keyword is the CoffeeScript module. If you want to compile a directory containing CoffeeScript files, we could write the following command:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">'run' : 'n.coffee -c coffee-lib/ -o lib/'</pre><p>Even if CoffeeScript isn&#8217;t globally installed, you can ensure it will run on all OSs from the local <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p><p>Now you can use the command template I mentioned (<a
href="https://github.com/volojs/create-command-template" alt="Command Template">download here</a>, by the way) to create a reusable Volo command to use in all your projects. For example, if you have a module that backs up your app, you may want to include it in all your projects.</p><blockquote><p>Create a standard NPM module that exports the aforementioned properties (<code>summary</code>, <code>run</code> etc) and require the module into your Volofile.</p></blockquote><p>So, with your package added to NPM, you can just type:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">npm install commandName</pre><p>And in your volofile, just type:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">module.exports = {
    'commandName': require('node_modules/commandName/index')
};</pre><p>Where <code>index.js</code> is the name of your extension. Because your file exports the necessary properties, the options will be directly injected into your volofile under the given command name. I wouldn&#8217;t really call it a custom feature (it&#8217;s standard JavaScript), but it&#8217;s still nice to know you have this option.</p><p>Now with the theory out of the way, let&#8217;s look into a real-world example. We&#8217;ll build an app using Volo.</p><hr
/><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Volo is a NPM package, so installing it is as simple as:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">(sudo) npm install -g volo</pre><p>For this article, I thought I would create a small web page for generating a map of your area, showing who the FourSquare mayors of your favorite sites. It&#8217;s not an incredible deep idea, but it will put Volo through the paces.</p><p>So to begin, we need a repo. You can find a number of starter templates, created specifically for Volo, by simply searching GitHub. The default template comes with the bare necessities: a simple HTML skeleton and a JavaScript folder with an AMD barebones setup.</p><blockquote><p>You also get a volofile with a build command for compiling the project&#8217;s JavaScript and CSS files.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not going to use the standard template, as I would like to have a few more resources. After a quick GitHub search, I found <a
href="https://github.com/volojs/create-responsive-template" alt="Responsive Template">an official template</a> that contains the defaults, the bootstrap framework, and other resources.</p><p>So to create our new project (which I named &#8216;turf&#8217;), you can simply type the following in a terminal window:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo create turf volojs/create-responsive-template
cd turf</pre><p>This creates the project folder and downloads a snapshot of the specified repo. Next, to download other resources. We will obviously use jQuery, so let&#8217;s add it:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add jquery</pre><p>We also need a way to display a map on the page. Google Maps comes to mind, so we&#8217;ll use a library named <a
href="https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps">gmaps</a>. The JavaScript file contains the entire library; therefore, we don&#8217;t really need the rest of the repo. Additionally, you can see that the library is stored within a variable named <code>GMaps</code>, and it requires the Google maps API as a dependency.</p><blockquote><p>There is one small problem with this: the Google Maps API is not AMD compliant and is an asynchronous library.</p></blockquote><p>When you load the single URL, it continues to load other resources on its own. This makes using standard require.js a problem, but there&#8217;s a plugin that handles this exact situation. It&#8217;s part of a repo called &#8220;requirejs-plugins&#8221;, but once again, we don&#8217;t need the entire repo. So, type the following in the terminal window:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add requirejs-plugins#src/async.js</pre><p>With the async plugin, we can load our special asynchronous dependencies.</p><p>We have two options to install the actual plugin:</p><ul><li>Convert the library to be AMD-compliant.</li><li>Use require.js&#8217; shim feature for adding non-AMD files.</li></ul><p>I&#8217;ll show you how to use both options. To convert the file, just add it. Volo will automatically detect that the file needs to be converted:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add HPNeo/gmaps#gmaps.js</pre><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Volo was created with a very special relationship to GitHub; it understands GIT repos, as well as branches and tags.</p></blockquote><p>According to the project&#8217;s Github page, it relies on the google maps API. There is a small issue with entering the URL because it contains unsupported characters (the equals sign). So let&#8217;s use a placeholder; just type <code>googlemaps</code> and hit enter. Next, we need to specify what we want to export. Type <code>GMaps</code> (with the two capital letters; that&#8217;s the name of the variable) and hit enter. Volo will finish converting it and add it to the <code>js/lib</code> folder.</p><p>Why the <code>js/lib</code> folder? If you take a look at the <code>package.json</code> file in the root of your project, you will see an entry called <code>baseUrl</code> under the <code>amd</code> property. This tells Volo where to put all downloaded JavaScript files. There is actually a number of locations Volo looks in to decide where to put stuff:</p><ol><li><code>baseDir</code> property under an entry named <code>volo</code></li><li><code>baseUrl</code> property again under <code>volo</code></li><li><code>baseUrl</code> under <code>amd</code> like we have here</li><li>a <code>js</code> folder in your current directory</li><li>a <code>scripts</code> folder in your current directory</li></ol><p>If none of these locations exist, Volo puts the file in the current directory.</p><p>With the module installed, we still need to replace the placeholder we created for the Google Maps API. Open the <code>www/js/lib/gmaps.js</code> file and replace the placeholder in the first (or second) line with the following:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">async!http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&amp;amp;libraries=places</pre><p>This tells Volo to include the async plugin and pass it the URL for the Google Maps API.</p><p>The GMaps module is now fully installed, but it requires you to enter specific longitude and latitude coordinates&#8211;something most users will not know. So we should have some kind of autocomplete plugin that converts location names to coordinates.</p><p>After another quick Github search, I found a jQuery plugin called <a
href="https://github.com/ubilabs/geocomplete" alt="geocomplete">geocomplete</a> by ubilabs. It too is not AMD compliant, but we will use require.js&#8217; shim feature. In the terminal type the following command:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">volo add -amdoff ubilabs/geocomplete#jquery.geocomplete.js geocomplete</pre><p>The <code>amdoff</code> option prevents Volo from converting the file, and the ending parameter renames the file from <code>jquery.geocomplete.js</code> to <code>geocomplete.js</code>. This is not mandatory, but it makes referencing it more convenient.</p><p>Now open the <code>www/js/app.js</code> file, and replace the require.js config declaration at the top:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">requirejs.config({
    baseUrl: 'js/lib',
    paths: {
        app: '../app'
    },
    shim: {
        'geocomplete' : {
            deps: ['jquery', 'async!http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&amp;amp;libraries=places']
        }
    }
});</pre><p>Just to run through the settings that were already there, <code>baseUrl</code> tells require.js where to look for relative files, and the <code>paths.app</code> option tells require.js that if a module name has a reference to a location named &#8220;app&#8221;, then to replace with what is specified (&#8216;../app&#8217;).</p><p>The <code>shim</code> section is what I added to the file. It tells require.js to first load jQuery and the Google Maps API when someone loads a file named <code>geocomplete</code>. You could optionally set another property called <code>exports</code>, the name of the variable to export. We don&#8217;t need to export anything because this is a plugin and it attaches to the jQuery object.</p><p>At this point, we have the files necessary to display the map and retrieve the necessary coordinates. We haven&#8217;t written any code, but we do have all the dependencies.</p><hr
/><h2>The Outline</h2><p>To begin prototyping our app, we need to write some HTML. Open up the <code>index.html</code> file and remove everything inside the body tags except the <code>&lt;script /&gt;</code> element at the bottom. You should be left with a file like the following:</p><pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;css/app.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script async data-main=&quot;js/app&quot; src=&quot;js/lib/require.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre><p>Next, add a text input field for the search box and a placeholder for the actual map. Your new body area should look something like this:</p><pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;span8 offset2&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;row text-center&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;input class=&quot;input-xxlarge&quot; id=&quot;search&quot;&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;row text-center&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div id=&quot;map&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script async data-main=&quot;js/app&quot; src=&quot;js/lib/require.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre><p>It&#8217;s a little more than the basics so that it conforms to bootstrap&#8217;s CSS rules. I gave the text input an ID of <code>search</code> and the map&#8217;s <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> an ID of <code>map</code>. Now let&#8217;s open the JavaScript file.</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Volo is an application that aids front-end developers by automating their processes.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll break it down for those of you who are new to require.js. The primary reason to use something like require.js is to make sure your scripts&#8217; dependencies are loaded when, and only when, your script actually needs them. This increases the overall speed of your site and simplifies your HTML files (you don&#8217;t need reference many scripts).</p><p>You can see the script at the bottom of the HTML file points to the require.js library, and it also has a <code>data-main</code> attribute that automatically runs once require.js is ready.</p><p>If you open <code>js/app.js</code>, our modified config section and a require statement at the bottom. Notice that you don&#8217;t need the file extension. In the index file, we referenced <code>js/app</code> (without the <code>.js</code>), and here load <code>app/main</code>.</p><p>Normally, a reference to <code>app/main</code> would map to a file called <code>main.js</code> inside a folder called <code>app</code> (all relative to the <code>js/lib</code> folder). But remember in the config, we said any reference to a location called <code>app</code>, should be replaced with <code>../app</code>. Instead of searching for <code>js/lib/app/main.js</code>, require.js will retrieve <code>js/app/main.js</code>.</p><p>Next, open <code>js/app/main.js</code>, remove everything and type the following:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">define(['jquery', 'gmaps', 'geocomplete'], function ($, gmaps) {
    $(document).ready(function () {
         $(&quot;#search&quot;).geocomplete();
    });
});</pre><p>The first parameter is an array of our dependencies. The second is a function with parameter names for jQuery (<code>$</code>) and GMaps (<code>gmaps</code>). Remember that geocomplete is a jQuery plugin, so there&#8217;s no reason to give it a corresponding parameter..</p><blockquote><p>The function passed as the second parameter executes after the dependencies finish loading.</p></blockquote><p>Inside this function, we execute the <code>geocomplete()</code> method when the document is ready.</p><p>You can now open the page in your browser, and if all went well, the text box should say &#8220;Enter a Location&#8221;. Start typing, and you&#8217;ll see some results.</p><p>Next, we need to handle the event when a match is found, i.e. when the user presses the Enter key on a place&#8217;s name. These events are: <code>geocode:result</code> and the <code>geocode:error</code>. Add the code to handle these events:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">$(document).ready(function () {
    $(&quot;#search&quot;).geocomplete()
    .bind(&quot;geocode:result&quot;, function(event, result){
        //On Result
    })
    .bind(&quot;geocode:error&quot;, function(event, result){
         alert(&quot;Location not Found&quot;);
    });
});</pre><p>The next step is to retrieve the latitude and longitude and generate a new map. The lat/long are stored in properties named <code>geometry.location.hb</code> and <code>geometry.location.ib</code>, respectively. Add the following code inside the <code>geocode:result</code> handler:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">var lat = result.geometry.location.hb;
var lng = result.geometry.location.ib;

var map = new gmaps({
    div : &quot;#map&quot;,
    lat : lat,
    lng : lng,
    height : '380px' 
});</pre><p>We store the coordinates and load a new map. Creaing a map is simple: we pass the container&#8217;s ID along with the coordinates and height.</p><p>You should now be able to search and display a map. Next, we need to interface with Foursquare and display the &#8220;mayors&#8221; of your city.</p><hr
/><h2>Interfacing with Foursquare</h2><p>We first need an interface to the foursquare API. To save time, and to stay on topic, I created a repo that we can clone. So in the terminal window, type:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">git clone https://github.com/gmanricks/MayorAPI www/foursquare</pre><p>This downloads the repo and places it in a folder named <code>foursquare</code> under the <code>www</code> directory.</p><p>Next, open <code>foursquare.php</code> and insert your client-id and client-secret into the class&#8217; constants. If you don&#8217;t already have this information, you can get it from <a
href="https://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> by registering an app.</p><p>The other file in the repo (<code>data.php</code>) retrieves the map coordinates via GET parameters and returns a JSON object. So to add the mayors to the map, we need to rewrite the <code>geocomplete:result</code> event handler:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">.bind(&quot;geocode:result&quot;, function(event, result){
    var lat = result.geometry.location.hb;
    var lng = result.geometry.location.ib;
    $.get(&quot;foursquare/data.php?lat=&quot; + lat + &quot;&amp;lng=&quot; + lng, function(d){
        var map = new gmaps({
            div : &quot;#map&quot;,
            lat : lat,
            lng : lng,
            height : '380px' 
        });
        var places = JSON.parse(d);
        if(places.error){
            alert(&quot;The rate limit has been hit&quot;);
        }
        else{
            for (var index in places) {
                var place = places[index];
                if(place.mayor.photo){
                    var html = '&lt;div class=&quot;mayor&quot;&gt;'
                             +     '&lt;div class=&quot;person&quot;&gt;'
                             +         '&lt;img class=&quot;img-circle img-polaroid&quot; src=&quot;'
                             +               place.mayor.photo.prefix + &quot;60x60&quot; + place.mayor.photo.suffix 
                             +           '&quot; /&gt;' 
                             +     '&lt;/div&gt;'
                             +     '&lt;div class=&quot;label label-inverse&quot;&gt;' + place.mayor.name + '&lt;/div&gt;'
                             + '&lt;/div&gt;';
                    map.drawOverlay({
                        lat : place.lat,
                        lng : place.lng,
                        content : html
                    });
                }
            }
        }
    });
})</pre><p>We first define the <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code> variables, but instead of immediately creating the map, we wait for our Ajax request to complete. We&#8217;re making about eleven API calls behind the scenes, so it might take ten or fifteen seconds.</p><p>Next, we make sure the rate limit hasn&#8217;t been hit and alert the user appropriately. Finally, we cycle through the results, adding each one to the map using a command from the GMaps library.</p><p>You can now open the page and test it out; everything should work! With a little styling and some design, it could look something like this:</p><div

/><h2>Optimizing with Volo</h2><p>Our app is complete, and the last step is to optimize it. Let&#8217;s first delete the files we do not use. In the <code>js/app/</code> folder, you can remove everything but the <code>main.js</code> file. In the <code>js/lib/</code> folder, remove the files named <code>appCache.js</code> and <code>network.js</code>. You also don&#8217;t need the <code>manifest.webapp</code> file, but you could keep if you so desire.</p><p>Now open the <code>volofile</code>, and you can see that the template came with a pretty complicated build command for optimizing and setting up the project&#8217;s JavaScript and CSS files. We don&#8217;t need such an elaborate script, so delete everything from the file and replace it with the following:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">module.exports = {
    'build' : {
        'summary' : 'Command to compile the source files',
        'run' : [
            'v.rm www-built',
            'v.copyDir www www-built',
            'v.rm www-built/js',
            'node tools/r.js -o baseUrl=www/js/lib paths.app=../app paths.requireLib=require name=app include=requireLib out=www-built/js/lib/require.js',
            'v.rm www-built/css',
            'node tools/r.js -o cssIn=www/css/app.css out=www-built/css/app.css'
        ]
    }
};</pre><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Volo is an omni-tool: you get what you put into it.</p></blockquote><p>This is much more simple. Here, we create a command named <code>build</code> that removes the previous built folde if it exists. It then copies the entire <code>www</code> folder as a base for our compiled version. Next, we delete the <code>js</code> directory (we&#8217;ll replace it with the optimized version).</p><p>Then we run require.js&#8217; optimizer to compile the JavaScript files into a single file. You may notice it renames the final product to <code>require.js</code>; this is kind of a &#8220;hack&#8221; because it&#8217;s not really the require.js library. But since our HTML file has a reference to <code>require.js</code> already, it&#8217;s easier to rename the Javascript file than to parsing all HTML files and change the script references.</p><p>Once that command completes, we remove the CSS folder (again to replace it with the optimized version). And last but not least, we run the require.js optimizer again, this time for the CSS.</p><p>You can now execute <code>volo build</code> from your terminal window and Volo will run this series of commands.</p><p>In your browser, you can navigate to the <code>www-built</code> folder instead of the <code>www</code> folder to make sure it still works. On my computer, building the project cut the file size in half, from just under a megabyte to ~400kb. You can probably get it even smaller if you minify the CSS.</p><hr
/><h2>Summary</h2><p>In this article, I taught you Volo&#8217;s syntax and we built an example application. We learned how to use Volo to create a project, add dependencies, add custom commands for automating common tasks and optimize an entire project.</p><p>To sum up, Volo is an omni-tool: you get what you put into it. You have a few, but powerful, commands, but Volo&#8217;s true power comes from it&#8217;s incredible extendibility and ultimately its community.</p><p>So what do you think about Volo?

The resulting system will allow us to write easy test scenarios in JavaScript, and test those scenarios both in real browsers and a headless simulator.</p><p><span
id="more-30545"></span></p><hr
/><h2>Choosing Components</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> The obvious downside to Selenium is that it requires a full graphical desktop for any and all tests.</p></blockquote><p>To begin, we have to choose a browser control or emulation engine to simulate an end-user. For a long time, the primary player in this field was <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>, and it still is. Selenium allows for automated control of real browsers on real operating systems, which is its primary advantage: you can be absolutely certain that the tests represent reality as closely as possible.</p><p>The obvious downside to Selenium is that it requires a full graphical desktop for any and all tests. As a result, your tests can become slow. However, Selenium can be fantastic, if you have the necessary resources to set up virtual machines for different operating systems and connect it all together.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum is <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>: A small, but excellent project, running a WebKit engine with full JavaScript access, but without the graphical portion. PhantomJS is a cinch to set up, runs on any machine, and is significantly faster.</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> Selenium can now control PhantomJS in the same way that it does any other browser.</p></blockquote><p>PhantomJS, being a full WebKit, covers 90% of your functional testing needs. After all, if your application runs in WebKit correctly, it&#8217;s likely that it will run correctly in other browsers. <em>Obviously, this excludes Internet Explorer 6?8</em>.</p><p>However, as your project becomes increasingly popular, that remaining 10% becomes a significant issue. If your functional testing suite is set up on PhantomJS directly, it would be a pain to rewrite the tests for Selenium.</p><p>Luckily, recently, <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/release-1.8.html">near the tail end of 2012</a>, we received a gift in the form of PhantomJS bindings to Selenium. In other words, Selenium can now control PhantomJS in the same way that it does any other browser.</p><p>Given that Selenium, itself, does not need any complicated setup and can run anywhere, we can use Selenium bindings to control PhantomJS and cover 90% of our testing needs. If you later need more powerful testing, you can set up extra browser connections to Selenium without changing a single line in your code.</p><p>Thus, our choice for browser engine are <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> with <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>.</p><h3>Describing Tests</h3><p>Selenium offers bindings in most popular programming languages, so we can choose a language according to our needs. This is perhaps the most controversial piece of this article: I consider JavaScript to be the best choice for describing functional tests for websites and web applications.</p><ul><li>No matter which back-end technology you use, your front-end will always use JavaScript (<em>This applies even if you use a language that compiles down to vanilla JavaScript, like CoffeeScript or TypeScript.</em></em>). As such, JavaScript will always be an understood language by at least one person on your team.</p><li>Next, consider the possibility for your functional tests to be written by non-programmers. The popularity of JavaScript on the front-end, combined with expressiveness in the ability to create clear domain-specific languages, clearly allows more people to write functional tests.</p><li>Lastly, it&#8217;s only natural to control a test browser with JavaScript, given that it is highly asynchronous, and is what we control the browser with on a daily basis.</ul><p>Selenium bindings for JavaScript are called, <a
href="https://github.com/Camme/webdriverjs/">webdriverjs</a>. Although the project is less mature than <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/#client-drivers">officially supported</a> drivers for Java, C#, Ruby and Python, it nevertheless already contains most of the functionality that we require.</p><h3>Test running</h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> For the purposes of this article, <a
href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a> with <a
href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> have been selected.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, we need a test runner, or an application to run tests by name, and pretty-print the output, while noting how many tests succeeded or failed. This test runner should also offer an assertion library, which allows the coder to express if a test succeeds or fails.</p><p>The choice is absolutely free here. There are plenty of JavaScript test runners, but for the purposes of this article, <a
href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a> with <a
href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> have been selected. Mocha provides a considerable amount of flexibility, a wide variety of output formats, and the popular Jasmine-like syntax. Chai allows you to write descriptive BDD-like assertions.</p><hr
/><h2>Setup</h2><p>Here&#8217;s the final stack that we&#8217;ll be using:</p><ol><li> <a
href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a> ? test runner</li><li> <a
href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> ? assertion library</li><li> <a
href="https://github.com/Camme/webdriverjs/">webdriverjs</a> ? browser control bindings</li><li> <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> ? browser abstraction and running factory</li><li> <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> ? fast headless browser</li></ol><h3>Node.js and npm</h3><p>Because most of our stack is based on JavaScript, we need <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and <a
href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a>. Both of these are common tools in the community, and I&#8217;ll assume that you already have them set up. If you don&#8217;t, use the installer on the <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js website</a>. Don&#8217;t worry; if anything goes wrong, there are plenty of Node install guides available around the web.</p><h3>Mocha, Chai and webdriverjs</h3><p>All three of these can be installed, using <code>npm</code>:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">sudo npm install -g mocha chai webdriverjs
</pre><p>Alternatively, you can install them locally in the directory where your tests are located:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">npm install mocha chai webdriverjs
</pre><h3>Selenium</h3><p><a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Download Selenium Server</a>. It is distributed as a single <code>jar</code> file, which you run simply:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar
</pre><p>As soon as you execute this command, it boots up a server to which your testing code will connect later on. Please note that you will need to run Selenium Server every time that you run your tests.</p><h3>PhantomJS</h3><h4>Quick version</h4><p>Use <code>npm</code> to install PhantomJS globally:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">sudo npm install -g phantomjs
</pre><h4>Other options</h4><p>We require a fresh version of PhantomJS &#8211; at least 1.8. This means that packages provided by your package manager (<code>apt-get</code>, MacPorts, &#8230;) will most likely be outdated.</p><p>You can install using npm without a global installation, or <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/download.html">using other methods</a> manually. In this case, however, you will have to tell Selenium where you placed PhantomJS every time you run Selenium:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
PATH=&quot;/path/to/node_modules/phantomjs/bin:$PATH&quot; java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar
</pre><hr
/><h2>Combining Everything</h2><p>Now that we have all the pieces, we have to put everything together.</p><p>Remember: before running any tests, you have to run Selenium Server:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar
</pre><p>Selenium will run PhantomJS internally; you don&#8217;t have to worry about that.</p><p>Now, we need to connect to Selenium from our JavaScript. Here&#8217;s a sample snippet, which will initiate a connection to Selenium and have a ready object to control our Selenium instance:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
// Use webdriverjs to create a Selenium Client
var client = require('webdriverjs').remote({
    desiredCapabilities: {
        // You may choose other browsers
        // http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities
        browserName: 'phantomjs'
    },
    // webdriverjs has a lot of output which is generally useless
    // However, if anything goes wrong, remove this to see more details
    logLevel: 'silent'
});

client.init();
</pre><p>Now, we can describe our tests and use the <code>client</code> variable to control the browser. A full reference for the webdriverjs API is <a
href="https://github.com/Camme/webdriverjs#list-of-current-helper-methods">available in the documentation</a>, but here&#8217;s a short example:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
client.url('http://example.com/')
client.getTitle(function(title){
    console.log('Title is', title);
});
client.setValue('#field', 'value');
client.submitForm();
client.end();
</pre><p>Let&#8217;s use the Mocha and Chai syntax to describe a test; we&#8217;ll test some properties of the <code>example.com</code> web page:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
describe('Test example.com', function(){
    before(function(done) {
        client.init().url('http://example.com', done);
    });

    describe('Check homepage', function(){
        it('should see the correct title', function(done) {
            client.getTitle(function(title){
                expect(title).to.have.string('Example Domain');
                done();
            });
        });

        it('should see the body', function(done) {
            client.getText('p', function(p){
                expect(title).to.have.string(
                    'for illustrative examples in documents.'
                );
                done();
            })
        });
    });

    after(function(done) {
        client.end();
        done();
    });
});
</pre><p>You might want to share one <code>client</code> initialization over many test files. Create a small Node module to initialize and import it into every test file:</p><p><code>client.js</code>:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
exports.client = require('webdriverjs').remote({
    // Settings
};
</pre><p><code>test.js</code>:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
var client = require('./client').client;
var expect = require('chai').expect;

// Perform tests
</pre><hr
/><h2>Running</h2><p>Mocha test suites are execute with the <code>mocha</code> binary. If you followed this guide and installed Mocha locally, then you should describe a full path to the binary yourself: <code>node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha</code>.</p><p>By default, Mocha treats any test that takes longer than two seconds as failed. Given that we are actually initializing a web browser and making an HTTP request, we need to increase this timeout to 5 or 10 seconds:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test.js -t 10000
</pre><p>If everything went according to plan, you should see output like this:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">  .

  ? 1 &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;test complete&lt;/span&gt;
</pre><hr
/><h2>The Next Steps</h2><p>Once you&#8217;ve achieved your desired functional testing results, you may want to consider improving your setup further.</p><p>Two obvious directions are continuous integration and distributed Selenium testing.</p><h3>Continuous integration</h3><blockquote
class=pullquote><p> Your goal should be to minimize the time that you spend running tests.</p></blockquote><p>You might want to use a full automatic continuous integration server, which will run the tests whenever needed automatically, and inform you if anything goes wrong.</p><p>In the world of open source, the role of such a server is covered by <a
href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins CI</a>: a convenient, powerful, easy to install service, which will run the tests whenever needed, execute them in any configuration that you provide, and possibly run many more build-related tasks, such as deploying your code to remote servers.</p><p>Alternatively, if you feel adventurous, you might experiment with a new project, called <a
href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/blob/master/README.md">GitLab CI</a>, which offers less features, but looks better and is integrated with <a
href="http://gitlabhq.com/">GitLab</a>, a self hosted GitHub clone.</p><p>In any case, your goal should be to minimize the time that you spend running tests. Instead, the tests should be run automatically and should only inform you if anything goes wrong.</p><h3>Selenium Grid</h3><p>Selenium has a number of implementation limitations. For example, you cannot run more than a few browsers on the same machine to be tested with Selenium.</p><p>In addition, you will notice that, once you have many tests, running all of them can become a lengthy process. Although continuous integration partly alleviates this problem, you might still want to run some tests in parallel on different machines.</p><p>Finally, you will soon notice that you want to test different browsers on different operating systems. And, while your testing code can, in theory, talk to different Selenium servers, once you grow a little, this setup needs centralization.</p><p><a
href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">Selenium Grid</a> setup tries to provide exactly that. Instead of having one Selenium server control a bunch of browsers on a machine, you have one Selenium server, which controls multiple Selenium nodes, each which controls only a few browsers on a single operating system.</p><hr
/><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The resulting stack, although not trivial, in reality, is quite simple. The addition of PhantomJS to the Selenium end allows us to begin using Selenium without much initial investment, such as setting up graphical test servers.</p><p>The usage of JavaScript as a testing engine ensures that our tests will be kept relevant in the context of web development for the foreseeable future.</p><div class="feedflare">

The resulting system will allow us to write easy test scenarios in JavaScript, and test those scenarios both in real browsers and a headless simulator.</p><p><span
id="more-30545"></span></p><hr
/><h2>Choosing Components</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> The obvious downside to Selenium is that it requires a full graphical desktop for any and all tests.</p></blockquote><p>To begin, we have to choose a browser control or emulation engine to simulate an end-user. For a long time, the primary player in this field was <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>, and it still is. Selenium allows for automated control of real browsers on real operating systems, which is its primary advantage: you can be absolutely certain that the tests represent reality as closely as possible.</p><p>The obvious downside to Selenium is that it requires a full graphical desktop for any and all tests. As a result, your tests can become slow. However, Selenium can be fantastic, if you have the necessary resources to set up virtual machines for different operating systems and connect it all together.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum is <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>: A small, but excellent project, running a WebKit engine with full JavaScript access, but without the graphical portion. PhantomJS is a cinch to set up, runs on any machine, and is significantly faster.</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> Selenium can now control PhantomJS in the same way that it does any other browser.</p></blockquote><p>PhantomJS, being a full WebKit, covers 90% of your functional testing needs. After all, if your application runs in WebKit correctly, it&#8217;s likely that it will run correctly in other browsers. <em>Obviously, this excludes Internet Explorer 6?8</em>.</p><p>However, as your project becomes increasingly popular, that remaining 10% becomes a significant issue. If your functional testing suite is set up on PhantomJS directly, it would be a pain to rewrite the tests for Selenium.</p><p>Luckily, recently, <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/release-1.8.html">near the tail end of 2012</a>, we received a gift in the form of PhantomJS bindings to Selenium. In other words, Selenium can now control PhantomJS in the same way that it does any other browser.</p><p>Given that Selenium, itself, does not need any complicated setup and can run anywhere, we can use Selenium bindings to control PhantomJS and cover 90% of our testing needs. If you later need more powerful testing, you can set up extra browser connections to Selenium without changing a single line in your code.</p><p>Thus, our choice for browser engine are <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> with <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>.</p><h3>Describing Tests</h3><p>Selenium offers bindings in most popular programming languages, so we can choose a language according to our needs. This is perhaps the most controversial piece of this article: I consider JavaScript to be the best choice for describing functional tests for websites and web applications.</p><ul><li>No matter which back-end technology you use, your front-end will always use JavaScript (<em>This applies even if you use a language that compiles down to vanilla JavaScript, like CoffeeScript or TypeScript.</em></em>). As such, JavaScript will always be an understood language by at least one person on your team.</p><li>Next, consider the possibility for your functional tests to be written by non-programmers. The popularity of JavaScript on the front-end, combined with expressiveness in the ability to create clear domain-specific languages, clearly allows more people to write functional tests.</p><li>Lastly, it&#8217;s only natural to control a test browser with JavaScript, given that it is highly asynchronous, and is what we control the browser with on a daily basis.</ul><p>Selenium bindings for JavaScript are called, <a
href="https://github.com/Camme/webdriverjs/">webdriverjs</a>. Although the project is less mature than <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/#client-drivers">officially supported</a> drivers for Java, C#, Ruby and Python, it nevertheless already contains most of the functionality that we require.</p><h3>Test running</h3><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p> For the purposes of this article, <a
href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a> with <a
href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> have been selected.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, we need a test runner, or an application to run tests by name, and pretty-print the output, while noting how many tests succeeded or failed. This test runner should also offer an assertion library, which allows the coder to express if a test succeeds or fails.</p><p>The choice is absolutely free here. There are plenty of JavaScript test runners, but for the purposes of this article, <a
href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a> with <a
href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> have been selected. Mocha provides a considerable amount of flexibility, a wide variety of output formats, and the popular Jasmine-like syntax. Chai allows you to write descriptive BDD-like assertions.</p><hr
/><h2>Setup</h2><p>Here&#8217;s the final stack that we&#8217;ll be using:</p><ol><li> <a
href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a> ? test runner</li><li> <a
href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> ? assertion library</li><li> <a
href="https://github.com/Camme/webdriverjs/">webdriverjs</a> ? browser control bindings</li><li> <a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> ? browser abstraction and running factory</li><li> <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> ? fast headless browser</li></ol><h3>Node.js and npm</h3><p>Because most of our stack is based on JavaScript, we need <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and <a
href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a>. Both of these are common tools in the community, and I&#8217;ll assume that you already have them set up. If you don&#8217;t, use the installer on the <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js website</a>. Don&#8217;t worry; if anything goes wrong, there are plenty of Node install guides available around the web.</p><h3>Mocha, Chai and webdriverjs</h3><p>All three of these can be installed, using <code>npm</code>:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">sudo npm install -g mocha chai webdriverjs
</pre><p>Alternatively, you can install them locally in the directory where your tests are located:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">npm install mocha chai webdriverjs
</pre><h3>Selenium</h3><p><a
href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Download Selenium Server</a>. It is distributed as a single <code>jar</code> file, which you run simply:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar
</pre><p>As soon as you execute this command, it boots up a server to which your testing code will connect later on. Please note that you will need to run Selenium Server every time that you run your tests.</p><h3>PhantomJS</h3><h4>Quick version</h4><p>Use <code>npm</code> to install PhantomJS globally:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">sudo npm install -g phantomjs
</pre><h4>Other options</h4><p>We require a fresh version of PhantomJS &#8211; at least 1.8. This means that packages provided by your package manager (<code>apt-get</code>, MacPorts, &#8230;) will most likely be outdated.</p><p>You can install using npm without a global installation, or <a
href="http://phantomjs.org/download.html">using other methods</a> manually. In this case, however, you will have to tell Selenium where you placed PhantomJS every time you run Selenium:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
PATH=&quot;/path/to/node_modules/phantomjs/bin:$PATH&quot; java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar
</pre><hr
/><h2>Combining Everything</h2><p>Now that we have all the pieces, we have to put everything together.</p><p>Remember: before running any tests, you have to run Selenium Server:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.28.0.jar
</pre><p>Selenium will run PhantomJS internally; you don&#8217;t have to worry about that.</p><p>Now, we need to connect to Selenium from our JavaScript. Here&#8217;s a sample snippet, which will initiate a connection to Selenium and have a ready object to control our Selenium instance:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
// Use webdriverjs to create a Selenium Client
var client = require('webdriverjs').remote({
    desiredCapabilities: {
        // You may choose other browsers
        // http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities
        browserName: 'phantomjs'
    },
    // webdriverjs has a lot of output which is generally useless
    // However, if anything goes wrong, remove this to see more details
    logLevel: 'silent'
});

client.init();
</pre><p>Now, we can describe our tests and use the <code>client</code> variable to control the browser. A full reference for the webdriverjs API is <a
href="https://github.com/Camme/webdriverjs#list-of-current-helper-methods">available in the documentation</a>, but here&#8217;s a short example:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
client.url('http://example.com/')
client.getTitle(function(title){
    console.log('Title is', title);
});
client.setValue('#field', 'value');
client.submitForm();
client.end();
</pre><p>Let&#8217;s use the Mocha and Chai syntax to describe a test; we&#8217;ll test some properties of the <code>example.com</code> web page:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
describe('Test example.com', function(){
    before(function(done) {
        client.init().url('http://example.com', done);
    });

    describe('Check homepage', function(){
        it('should see the correct title', function(done) {
            client.getTitle(function(title){
                expect(title).to.have.string('Example Domain');
                done();
            });
        });

        it('should see the body', function(done) {
            client.getText('p', function(p){
                expect(title).to.have.string(
                    'for illustrative examples in documents.'
                );
                done();
            })
        });
    });

    after(function(done) {
        client.end();
        done();
    });
});
</pre><p>You might want to share one <code>client</code> initialization over many test files. Create a small Node module to initialize and import it into every test file:</p><p><code>client.js</code>:</p><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
exports.client = require('webdriverjs').remote({
    // Settings
};
</pre><p><code>test.js</code>:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
var client = require('./client').client;
var expect = require('chai').expect;

// Perform tests
</pre><hr
/><h2>Running</h2><p>Mocha test suites are execute with the <code>mocha</code> binary. If you followed this guide and installed Mocha locally, then you should describe a full path to the binary yourself: <code>node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha</code>.</p><p>By default, Mocha treats any test that takes longer than two seconds as failed. Given that we are actually initializing a web browser and making an HTTP request, we need to increase this timeout to 5 or 10 seconds:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test.js -t 10000
</pre><p>If everything went according to plan, you should see output like this:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">  .

  ? 1 &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;test complete&lt;/span&gt;
</pre><hr
/><h2>The Next Steps</h2><p>Once you&#8217;ve achieved your desired functional testing results, you may want to consider improving your setup further.</p><p>Two obvious directions are continuous integration and distributed Selenium testing.</p><h3>Continuous integration</h3><blockquote
class=pullquote><p> Your goal should be to minimize the time that you spend running tests.</p></blockquote><p>You might want to use a full automatic continuous integration server, which will run the tests whenever needed automatically, and inform you if anything goes wrong.</p><p>In the world of open source, the role of such a server is covered by <a
href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins CI</a>: a convenient, powerful, easy to install service, which will run the tests whenever needed, execute them in any configuration that you provide, and possibly run many more build-related tasks, such as deploying your code to remote servers.</p><p>Alternatively, if you feel adventurous, you might experiment with a new project, called <a
href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci/blob/master/README.md">GitLab CI</a>, which offers less features, but looks better and is integrated with <a
href="http://gitlabhq.com/">GitLab</a>, a self hosted GitHub clone.</p><p>In any case, your goal should be to minimize the time that you spend running tests. Instead, the tests should be run automatically and should only inform you if anything goes wrong.</p><h3>Selenium Grid</h3><p>Selenium has a number of implementation limitations. For example, you cannot run more than a few browsers on the same machine to be tested with Selenium.</p><p>In addition, you will notice that, once you have many tests, running all of them can become a lengthy process. Although continuous integration partly alleviates this problem, you might still want to run some tests in parallel on different machines.</p><p>Finally, you will soon notice that you want to test different browsers on different operating systems. And, while your testing code can, in theory, talk to different Selenium servers, once you grow a little, this setup needs centralization.</p><p><a
href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">Selenium Grid</a> setup tries to provide exactly that. Instead of having one Selenium server control a bunch of browsers on a machine, you have one Selenium server, which controls multiple Selenium nodes, each which controls only a few browsers on a single operating system.</p><hr
/><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The resulting stack, although not trivial, in reality, is quite simple. The addition of PhantomJS to the Selenium end allows us to begin using Selenium without much initial investment, such as setting up graphical test servers.</p><p>The usage of JavaScript as a testing engine ensures that our tests will be kept relevant in the context of web development for the foreseeable future.</p><div class="feedflare">

/><h2>Command Line Interface?</h2><p>Yes, it&#8217;s that white (or green) on black screen, where mysterious text flows and strange commands execute. I know great programmers who never use the CLI; however, I also know basic computer users who do everything in the CLI instead of the graphical user interface (GUI). They have console applications to browse the web and file system, read mail, view images and edit text. They even watch YouTube videos and read PDF files without a GUI!</p><p>It&#8217;s up to each person to find his or her best workflow. Some prefer the GUI, while others enjoy the CLI.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The real CLI has little or nothing to do with what you see on TV. Rarely is the CLI realistically portrayed in movies or <a

/><h2>Terminology</h2><p>Newcomers to the Unix/Linux world are typically confused, when it comes to the difference between a terminal, a console and a shell.</p><div
class="tutorial_image"><img
src="http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/authors/jeremymcpeak/cmd-console-terminal-shell-schema.png" /></div><p>From the user&#8217;s perspective, there may be little to no difference between them, but in actuality, the the user uses a console to connect to a terminal, in order to look at the shell running on the computer.</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>It&#8217;s up to each person to find his or her best workflow.</p></blockquote><p>In ye olden days, these three items were separate hardware. The console was nothing more than a monitor and keyboard; it had no computing capabilities. It connected to a terminal, via a serial interface, the most common being the RS-232 connector.</p><p>A terminal is akin to an end-point to a mainframe. It usually had some computing capabilities and could communicate over a network, or some form of specialized connection, to a mainframe. A terminal also provided administrative rights to the system, which was why it was usually kept in a closed room. The consoles from the employees&#8217; area connected to these terminals, allowing them to work without having administrative access to the mainframe.</p><p>Consoles and terminals eventually merged in a single device, the most notorious being the VT terminals emulated in modern Linux distributions.</p><div

href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMYiktO0D64">Training Video for Bell Labs&#8217; Holmdel Computing Center &#8211; AT&amp;T Archives</a></p></div><p>The shell is the actual program capable of reading the user&#8217;s input and providing the result on the screen. A shell can be textual (like the CLI) or graphical (like Windows&#8217; GUI). In today&#8217;s computing, a shell is much more than a simple interface between the user and system. It is responsible for managing processes, windows, applications, commands and other aspects of the system.</p><blockquote><p>The CLI is a shell that offers a text-based interface to the user.</p></blockquote><p>The shell interprets the commands entered through the command line, and a user can combine multiple commands into a single script. Modern shells have a scripting language of their own, providing the ability to perform complex decisions.</p><p>Most modern Linux distributions, as well as Mac OSX, use a shell, called BASH. Solaris and OpenIndiana use KornShell by default, which is another variant of BASH. Please note that this tutorial will focus on BASH.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Windows users</strong> can also use BASH. It is distributed with Cygwin and MinGW.</p></div><hr
/><h2>Let&#8217;s Talk About BASH</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Most modern Linux distributions, as well as Mac OSX, use a shell, called BASH.</p></blockquote><p>BASH stands for Bourne Again Shell. It was released in 1989 as a reincarnation of the Bourne Shell, the then default shell on Unix systems. It was programmed by Stephen Bourne and came as a replacement for Thompson Shell, the first ever shell software for UNIX. The old Bourne Shell is still present in some Unix systems. You can usually find it as <code>/bin/sh</code>. However, even that has been replaced by BASH on most modern distributions; both <code>/bin/sh</code> and <code>/bin/bash</code> are executables for BASH.</p><h3>The BASH Prompt</h3><p>The one thing that you will always have is BASH&#8217;s prompt. It is a story in and of itself, and we could spend this entire tutorial on how to configure and personalize it. Instead, we&#8217;ll only discuss the basics in this tutorial.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/Personal/Programming/NetTuts $</pre><p>This is what my prompt looks like. The first word, <code>csaba</code> is my username, followed by <code>@</code> and my computer&#8217;s hostname, and then the current folder. The character &#8220;<code>~</code>&#8221; stands for the current user&#8217;s home directory &#8211; <code>/home/csaba</code>, in my case. The line ends with <code>$</code>. Whatever I type after the <code>$</code> is the command that I want my shell to execute.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Root is Special:</strong> If you are root, the prompt ends with <code>#</code> instead of <code>$</code>.</p></div><p>Of course, this is only a simple example; you can put a lot more information in your prompt line. Let&#8217;s explore some basic examples.</p><p>BASH has a set of special variables, <code>PS1</code>, <code>PS2</code>, <code>PS3</code> and <code>PS4</code>, which control the contents in the prompt at different stages of a program&#8217;s execution. We will only talk about <code>PS1</code> in this tutorial. You can check what the <code>PS1</code> variable contains with the following command:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/Personal/Programming/NetTuts $ echo $PS1
\[&#92;&#48;33[01;32m\]\u@\h\[&#92;&#48;33[01;34m\] \w \$\[&#92;&#48;33[00m\]
</pre><p>What you see here is my prompt, followed by a command <code>echo $PS1</code> and the output of the command. In BASH, you put the dollar sign before the variable name when you want to read its contents. The <code>echo</code> command simply outputs whatever it receives as a parameter. If the parameter is a variable, its value displays on the screen.</p><p>The output represents a format. <code>\[\033[01;32m\]</code> is a color code for green, and <code>\u</code> represents the current user&#8217;s username. The <code>\h</code> token stands for hostname, and <code>\[\033[01;34m\]</code> is the color code for blue. <code>\w</code> is the current directory, and <code>\[\033[00m\]</code> is a light gray color for whatever follows (the commands I type). Below is a screenshot, so that you can better visualize the result.</p><div
class="tutorial_image"><img
src="http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/authors/jeremymcpeak/cmd-console-prompt.png" /></div><p>There are special characters preceded by &#8220;\&#8221; that have their own special meaning. Otherwise, &#8220;\&#8221; denotes an escape character for what follows (as in the color codes).

/><h2>Input/Output</h2><p>Every command must communicate with the command line environment. Commands need input and provide output. <strong>Standard Input</strong> refers to source from where a command can read information. This is the keyboard by default, and it&#8217;s frequently referred to as &#8220;stdin&#8221;. <strong>Standard Output</strong> refers to the place where a command&#8217;s output will be sent. By default, this is the current console, and its usually referred to as &#8220;stdout&#8221;. <strong>Standard Error</strong> refers to the place where a command outputs its errors. This is the current console by default, and many refer to it as &#8220;stderr&#8221;.</p><p>What we defined so far simply states that a command can read from the keyboard and output its results, both good and bad, to the screen.</p><blockquote><p>In Unix (and similar systems) everything is a file. Your keyboard is a file, your mouse is a file, your screen is a file, programs are in files, text is in files, etc.</p></blockquote><p>A <strong>File Descriptor</strong> is an integer that the operating system&#8217;s kernel uses to reference open files. Every system has at least three file descriptors:</p><ul><li>Descriptor no. <strong>0</strong> &#8211; standard input.</li><li>Descriptor no. <strong>1</strong> &#8211; standard output.</li><li>Descriptor no. <strong>2</strong> &#8211; standard error.</li></ul><h3>Redirections</h3><p>Unix systems have a very powerful feature: because everything is a file, you can reference and redirect everything from one place to another. The redirection operators are <code>&lt;</code> for stdin and <code>&gt;</code> for stdout. So, if you want a command to read information from the keyboard, you can do something like this:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">$ someCommand &lt; </pre><p>But what if you want your command to read from a file? Well you can redirect a file into its stdin, like this:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">$ someCommand &lt; /your/file.txt</pre><p>If you want your command&#8217;s output to go into a file, you can use the <code>&gt;</code> operator. For example we&#8217;ve seen how to list files in a folder:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts/SecondDir $ ls -al

We can, however, use <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (a double <code>&gt;</code>) to append new data to an existing file.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts/SecondDir $ cd ..

drwxr-xr-x 2 csaba csaba 4096 Feb 24 00:06 SecondDir</pre><h3>Input/Output Redirections</h3><p>We can combine our knowledge and redirect stderr, stdin and stdout in different ways. In fact the commands below are doing the same thing:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al &gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al 1&gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile </pre><p>In the second command, we specified the source as standard output (<code>1&gt;</code>) right before the redirection. Please also note that there is no space between <code>1</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. In fact, placing a space between the two characters makes <code>1</code> a parameter and <code>&gt;</code> would automatically imply redirection of standard output. The two expressions below do the same thing and are different from the ones above:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al 1 &gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al 1 1&gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile </pre><p>Of course, these result in an error: &#8220;ls: cannot access 1: No such file or directory&#8221; &#8211; unless you really have a directory named <code>1</code>. This makes us wonder about the next steps we can take: redirecting errors.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al inexistenFilder &gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
ls: cannot access inexistenFilder: No such file or directory
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al inexistenFilder 2&gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile </pre><p>As you can see, the first command outputs stderr in the console and redirects stdout to a file. The result of the first command is an empty file and a message on the screen. The second command, however, redirects the errors to our file. The result is that if there were any outputs on standard output, they would go on the screen and errors would go to the file.</p><h3>A Real Life Example for I/O Redirection</h3><p>You basically have two options when you need to search for files in the console. The first is the <code>locate</code> command. It is usually, but not necessarily, installed on many modern Linux distributions. The <code>updatedb</code> command indexes your files and <code>locate</code> uses that database to find your files. It does not actually do a real-time search, it simply looks up indexes in a database. That&#8217;s why this application is usually scheduled for a daily <code>updatedb</code>.</p><blockquote><p>The second command is called, well, <code>find</code>.</p></blockquote><p>This command performs a real-time search. It is more accurate than <code>locate</code>, but is obviously much slower. Let&#8217;s play with it a little:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al

csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name ThirdFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile
</pre><p>I printed the two <code>ls</code> commands so that you can see the directory structure. The third command is our <code>find</code>. It has a complex parameter system that I will not detail here, but the above example demonstrates the most common use of <code>find</code>. The first parameter, <code>.</code>, is the directory in which we want to search.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Tip:</strong> <code>.</code> refers to the current directory. <code>..</code> refers to the parent directory.</p></div><p>The second parameter we used for <code>find</code> was <code>-name</code>, followed by a file&#8217;s name. We can use <code>?</code> and <code>*</code> in the <code>-name</code> parameter to broaden our search:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name ?File
./SecondDir/aFile
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name *File
./SecondDir/aFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile</pre><p><code>?</code> stands for any single character, and <code>*</code> refers to any number of any characters.</p><p>Next, we will create a directory and make it unreadable by our user. We have not yet reviewed permissions, but don&#8217;t worry, we will shortly. For now, simply try the following:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ mkdir ThirdDir
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ chmod 000 ThirdDir
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name *File
./SecondDir/aFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile
find: `./ThirdDir': Permission denied
</pre><p>I wanted you to not have permission to a directory so that I can demonstrate what <code>find</code> outputs in this case. It tries to access all the directories and search for files that match the given pattern. When it can&#8217;t access a directory, it outputs a message. This is OK when you have one or two messages, but try to search for something starting from the root folder as an ordinary user. You will get hundreds of such error messages and probably only one or two search results. You don&#8217;t want to miss the results; you want to get rid of the error messages.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name *File 2&gt; /dev/null
./SecondDir/aFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile</pre><p>We redirected stderr into <code>/dev/null</code>. This points to&#8230; well nothing. Whatever you throw into <code>/dev/null</code> will simply vanish. It is common practice to send errors there when you don&#8217;t want to see them. If you prefer your results in a file, and your errors sent to <code>/dev/null</code>, you can use multiple redirections:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name *File 2&gt; /dev/null 1&gt;./SecondDir/ThirdFile
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $</pre><p>As you can see, this command outputs nothing to the screen because both errors and standard output are sent to different files. But what if you want both in the same file? Well, you can send stderr into stdout and then send stdout to a file:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">find . -name *File 1&gt;./SecondDir/ThirdFile 2&gt;&amp;1</pre><p>Redirections are interpreted from right to left. So the first one that happens is <code>2>&amp;1</code>, which redirects standard error to standard output. Then <code>1>./SecondDir/ThirdFile</code> redirects standard output (with the errors already in it) into the specified file.</p><hr
/><h2>Let&#8217;s Talk About Permissions</h2><p>The permissions discussed in this tutorial are applicable to *nix operating systems. I am not that familiar with the latest Windows versions, but Microsoft uses a different concept for permissions on their file systems.</p><h3>Users and Groups</h3><p>There can be several users on the same computer. In fact, several applications register their own special user and use it to run the program in a restricted environment. Each user can be identified by their name and/or their ID, also known as UID.</p><blockquote><p>You can find the list of the currently existing users in the file <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Groups are listed in the file <code>/etc/group</code>. A group has a name and ID (known as GID), and a group is a container of zero or more users. Each user usually has at least one corresponding group, which has the same name as the user.</p><h3>The Owner</h3><p>Files have owners, and the user that creates a file is, by default, its owner. Directories are just special files, and they have the same owner and permission rules as ordinary files.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al

/><h2>The Cat, Sed, and Pipe</h2><p>Here are a few of the most useful commands.</p><h3>Cat</h3><p>This command lets you read the contents of a file. Simply provide the filename as a parameter, and it outputs the file&#8217;s contents to stdout.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ cat ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
./SecondDir/aFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile
find: `./ThirdDir': Permission denied</pre><h3>Grep</h3><p>Grep searches for a pattern and outputs the matching lines. You can optionally specify a file to search as the third parameter:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ grep &quot;AnotherFile&quot; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile</pre><p>Adding the <code>--color</code> option highlights the matched word in the the resulting lines.</p><h3>Pipe</h3><p>The pipe is represented by the <code>|</code> character; it takes one command&#8217;s output and feeds it to a second command. This may sound simple, but it&#8217;s a huge thing. That single character has tens of thousands of lines of code behind it so that you can do this:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ cat ./SecondDir/ThirdFile | grep &quot;Another&quot;
./SecondDir/AnotherFile</pre><p>This actually runs the <code>cat</code> command, and instead of outputing the results to stdout, it feeds that output to <code>grep</code>. The <code>grep</code> command uses that data and searches for the string &#8220;Another&#8221;. The result is identical to our previous example.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong><a

It is a great video, but scroll to 4:56, if you are only interested in the PIPEs.</p></div><h3>Sed</h3><p>The <code>sed</code> command allows you to execute regular expressions on its input. It can read from a file or be used in a piped command. It outputs the result to stdout.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ cat ./SecondDir/ThirdFile | grep &quot;Another&quot; | sed -e &quot;s/AnotherFile/MyFile/&quot;
./SecondDir/MyFile</pre><p>This example adds a <code>sed</code> to our previous command. With the help of <code>sed</code>, we replaced the string &#8220;AnotherFile&#8221; with &#8220;MyFile&#8221; in the output of the <code>cat...grep</code>. Pretty cool, right?</p><p>The <code>sed</code> command can accept several parameters. Specifying the <code>-e</code> argument executes the regular expression on its input.

/><h2>Defining Your Own Commands</h2><p>Let&#8217;s imagine that you execute the following <code>ssh</code> connection command frequently:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ssh my_username@complicated.server.address.com -p 8743</pre><p>You can shorten this by creating a custom command, say <code>sshcon</code>. You could create your own commands by using an alias. Alias syntax is in the form of: <code>alias shorthand='original_command'</code>.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ alias sshcon='ssh my_username@complicated.server.address.com -p 8743'</pre><p>Running <code>sshcon</code> executes the more complicated <code>ssh</code> command. But aliases are temporary; they&#8217;re forgotten when you log out. One possible solution is to edit your <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p><h3>.bashrc and .bash.profile</h3><p>The <code>.bashrc</code> file is usually located in your home directory. This file lets you specify any command(s) you want to execute whenever you open a console or log into a shell. Let&#8217;s add the aforementioned <code>sshcon</code> alias to this file.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ mcedit ~/.bashrc</pre><p>Add your code to the end of the file, hit F2 to save the file, and then ESC twice to close the file. Press CTRL+D to log out from the shell. Open another shell and try your alias command. Voila.</p><p>Some operating systems, such as Solaris, may not have a <code>~/.bashrc</code> file. In this case, you can do your magic by editing <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. In fact, <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is always present on all systems.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>The Hidden Files:</strong> Files that begin with a dot (<code>.</code>) denote a hidden file.</p></div><hr
/><h2>A Little Networking</h2><p>Let&#8217;s play with the network a little.</p><h3>Ping</h3><p>The <code>ping</code> command is an easy way to check if a server is up and accessible.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=47 time=44.0 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=47 time=65.6 ms

csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ping inexistent.server
ping: unknown host inexistent.server
</pre><p>Its syntax is easy: <code>ping IP_address_or_name</code>. If the server is accessible, you will see a list of reply lines with details. If it&#8217;s not, an error message states the problem.</p><h3>Traceroute</h3><p>The <code>traceroute</code> command displays the route a packet takes from your computer to the destination device.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ traceroute 8.8.8.8

And despite their slight differences in syntax, their functionality is basically the same. This command allows us to see the current routing table of the system, and if necessary, add/delete static routes.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

The term &#8220;default&#8221; means anything not matched by something else or sent here. Loopback is our virtual local device, the one having the IP 127.0.0.1. This IP always refers to the local, machine and it is present on all operating systems ([ed] there&#8217;s no place like 127.0.0.1).</p><p>The second column is the gateway the connection uses to reach its destination. The first line displays my default gateway as 192.168.111.1. The second line for loopback goes to localhost, and the third line goes to <code>*</code>, no gateway is necessary for acessing our own network.</p><p>The third interesting thing here is the last column: &#8220;Iface&#8221;. It specifies the interface used to communicate to the specific destination. In our example, loopback communication goes over the loopback interface <code>lo</code>. Everything else goes through the <code>eno1</code> interface.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you find no <code>route</code> command, try using <code>netstat -nr</code>. It should produce similar output.</p></div><h3>Network Configuration</h3><p>If you want a quick glance at your network configuration, just type <code>ifconfig</code> in the command line.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ifconfig

</pre><p>There is a lot of information here. First, we have two sections, each for a network adapter. My wired network card is called <code>eno1</code> on my system. You may see things like <code>e1000g0</code>, <code>eth0</code>, <code>en0</code> or other names. Wireless network devices usually (but not always) begin with a &#8220;w&#8221;.</p><p>On the same line is the current status of the interface. In this example, the interface is up, broadcasting, running, etc. The second line is for the IPv4 IP address, netmask and broadcast. The third line is very similar but for IPv6. The forth line, starting with &#8220;ether&#8221;, is the MAC address of the network card, and the remaining lines display data transfer statistics.</p><h3>Current Network Connections</h3><p>Another useful command is <code>netstat</code>. It can list all the network connections to the system, as well as the IPs, interfaces and ports the system listens on. Here is a part of <code>netstat</code>&#8216;s output on my system. I shortened it to eliminate irrelevant information:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ netstat -an

/><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>So there you have it: some of the most used CLI commands! Naturally, each of these commands are capable of much more than what I&#8217;ve covered in this tutorial. I hope I&#8217;ve shed a bit of light on some of these CLI mysteries. Thanks for reading!</p><div class="feedflare">

/><h2>Command Line Interface?</h2><p>Yes, it&#8217;s that white (or green) on black screen, where mysterious text flows and strange commands execute. I know great programmers who never use the CLI; however, I also know basic computer users who do everything in the CLI instead of the graphical user interface (GUI). They have console applications to browse the web and file system, read mail, view images and edit text. They even watch YouTube videos and read PDF files without a GUI!</p><p>It&#8217;s up to each person to find his or her best workflow. Some prefer the GUI, while others enjoy the CLI.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The real CLI has little or nothing to do with what you see on TV. Rarely is the CLI realistically portrayed in movies or <a

/><h2>Terminology</h2><p>Newcomers to the Unix/Linux world are typically confused, when it comes to the difference between a terminal, a console and a shell.</p><div
class="tutorial_image"><img
src="http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/authors/jeremymcpeak/cmd-console-terminal-shell-schema.png" /></div><p>From the user&#8217;s perspective, there may be little to no difference between them, but in actuality, the the user uses a console to connect to a terminal, in order to look at the shell running on the computer.</p><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>It&#8217;s up to each person to find his or her best workflow.</p></blockquote><p>In ye olden days, these three items were separate hardware. The console was nothing more than a monitor and keyboard; it had no computing capabilities. It connected to a terminal, via a serial interface, the most common being the RS-232 connector.</p><p>A terminal is akin to an end-point to a mainframe. It usually had some computing capabilities and could communicate over a network, or some form of specialized connection, to a mainframe. A terminal also provided administrative rights to the system, which was why it was usually kept in a closed room. The consoles from the employees&#8217; area connected to these terminals, allowing them to work without having administrative access to the mainframe.</p><p>Consoles and terminals eventually merged in a single device, the most notorious being the VT terminals emulated in modern Linux distributions.</p><div

href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMYiktO0D64">Training Video for Bell Labs&#8217; Holmdel Computing Center &#8211; AT&amp;T Archives</a></p></div><p>The shell is the actual program capable of reading the user&#8217;s input and providing the result on the screen. A shell can be textual (like the CLI) or graphical (like Windows&#8217; GUI). In today&#8217;s computing, a shell is much more than a simple interface between the user and system. It is responsible for managing processes, windows, applications, commands and other aspects of the system.</p><blockquote><p>The CLI is a shell that offers a text-based interface to the user.</p></blockquote><p>The shell interprets the commands entered through the command line, and a user can combine multiple commands into a single script. Modern shells have a scripting language of their own, providing the ability to perform complex decisions.</p><p>Most modern Linux distributions, as well as Mac OSX, use a shell, called BASH. Solaris and OpenIndiana use KornShell by default, which is another variant of BASH. Please note that this tutorial will focus on BASH.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Windows users</strong> can also use BASH. It is distributed with Cygwin and MinGW.</p></div><hr
/><h2>Let&#8217;s Talk About BASH</h2><blockquote
class="pullquote"><p>Most modern Linux distributions, as well as Mac OSX, use a shell, called BASH.</p></blockquote><p>BASH stands for Bourne Again Shell. It was released in 1989 as a reincarnation of the Bourne Shell, the then default shell on Unix systems. It was programmed by Stephen Bourne and came as a replacement for Thompson Shell, the first ever shell software for UNIX. The old Bourne Shell is still present in some Unix systems. You can usually find it as <code>/bin/sh</code>. However, even that has been replaced by BASH on most modern distributions; both <code>/bin/sh</code> and <code>/bin/bash</code> are executables for BASH.</p><h3>The BASH Prompt</h3><p>The one thing that you will always have is BASH&#8217;s prompt. It is a story in and of itself, and we could spend this entire tutorial on how to configure and personalize it. Instead, we&#8217;ll only discuss the basics in this tutorial.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/Personal/Programming/NetTuts $</pre><p>This is what my prompt looks like. The first word, <code>csaba</code> is my username, followed by <code>@</code> and my computer&#8217;s hostname, and then the current folder. The character &#8220;<code>~</code>&#8221; stands for the current user&#8217;s home directory &#8211; <code>/home/csaba</code>, in my case. The line ends with <code>$</code>. Whatever I type after the <code>$</code> is the command that I want my shell to execute.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Root is Special:</strong> If you are root, the prompt ends with <code>#</code> instead of <code>$</code>.</p></div><p>Of course, this is only a simple example; you can put a lot more information in your prompt line. Let&#8217;s explore some basic examples.</p><p>BASH has a set of special variables, <code>PS1</code>, <code>PS2</code>, <code>PS3</code> and <code>PS4</code>, which control the contents in the prompt at different stages of a program&#8217;s execution. We will only talk about <code>PS1</code> in this tutorial. You can check what the <code>PS1</code> variable contains with the following command:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/Personal/Programming/NetTuts $ echo $PS1
\[&#92;&#48;33[01;32m\]\u@\h\[&#92;&#48;33[01;34m\] \w \$\[&#92;&#48;33[00m\]
</pre><p>What you see here is my prompt, followed by a command <code>echo $PS1</code> and the output of the command. In BASH, you put the dollar sign before the variable name when you want to read its contents. The <code>echo</code> command simply outputs whatever it receives as a parameter. If the parameter is a variable, its value displays on the screen.</p><p>The output represents a format. <code>\[\033[01;32m\]</code> is a color code for green, and <code>\u</code> represents the current user&#8217;s username. The <code>\h</code> token stands for hostname, and <code>\[\033[01;34m\]</code> is the color code for blue. <code>\w</code> is the current directory, and <code>\[\033[00m\]</code> is a light gray color for whatever follows (the commands I type). Below is a screenshot, so that you can better visualize the result.</p><div

/><h2>Input/Output</h2><p>Every command must communicate with the command line environment. Commands need input and provide output. <strong>Standard Input</strong> refers to source from where a command can read information. This is the keyboard by default, and it&#8217;s frequently referred to as &#8220;stdin&#8221;. <strong>Standard Output</strong> refers to the place where a command&#8217;s output will be sent. By default, this is the current console, and its usually referred to as &#8220;stdout&#8221;. <strong>Standard Error</strong> refers to the place where a command outputs its errors. This is the current console by default, and many refer to it as &#8220;stderr&#8221;.</p><p>What we defined so far simply states that a command can read from the keyboard and output its results, both good and bad, to the screen.</p><blockquote><p>In Unix (and similar systems) everything is a file. Your keyboard is a file, your mouse is a file, your screen is a file, programs are in files, text is in files, etc.</p></blockquote><p>A <strong>File Descriptor</strong> is an integer that the operating system&#8217;s kernel uses to reference open files. Every system has at least three file descriptors:</p><ul><li>Descriptor no. <strong>0</strong> &#8211; standard input.</li><li>Descriptor no. <strong>1</strong> &#8211; standard output.</li><li>Descriptor no. <strong>2</strong> &#8211; standard error.</li></ul><h3>Redirections</h3><p>Unix systems have a very powerful feature: because everything is a file, you can reference and redirect everything from one place to another. The redirection operators are <code>&lt;</code> for stdin and <code>&gt;</code> for stdout. So, if you want a command to read information from the keyboard, you can do something like this:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">$ someCommand &lt; </pre><p>But what if you want your command to read from a file? Well you can redirect a file into its stdin, like this:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">$ someCommand &lt; /your/file.txt</pre><p>If you want your command&#8217;s output to go into a file, you can use the <code>&gt;</code> operator. For example we&#8217;ve seen how to list files in a folder:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts/SecondDir $ ls -al

We can, however, use <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (a double <code>&gt;</code>) to append new data to an existing file.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts/SecondDir $ cd ..

drwxr-xr-x 2 csaba csaba 4096 Feb 24 00:06 SecondDir</pre><h3>Input/Output Redirections</h3><p>We can combine our knowledge and redirect stderr, stdin and stdout in different ways. In fact the commands below are doing the same thing:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al &gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al 1&gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile </pre><p>In the second command, we specified the source as standard output (<code>1&gt;</code>) right before the redirection. Please also note that there is no space between <code>1</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. In fact, placing a space between the two characters makes <code>1</code> a parameter and <code>&gt;</code> would automatically imply redirection of standard output. The two expressions below do the same thing and are different from the ones above:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al 1 &gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al 1 1&gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile </pre><p>Of course, these result in an error: &#8220;ls: cannot access 1: No such file or directory&#8221; &#8211; unless you really have a directory named <code>1</code>. This makes us wonder about the next steps we can take: redirecting errors.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al inexistenFilder &gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
ls: cannot access inexistenFilder: No such file or directory
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al inexistenFilder 2&gt; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile </pre><p>As you can see, the first command outputs stderr in the console and redirects stdout to a file. The result of the first command is an empty file and a message on the screen. The second command, however, redirects the errors to our file. The result is that if there were any outputs on standard output, they would go on the screen and errors would go to the file.</p><h3>A Real Life Example for I/O Redirection</h3><p>You basically have two options when you need to search for files in the console. The first is the <code>locate</code> command. It is usually, but not necessarily, installed on many modern Linux distributions. The <code>updatedb</code> command indexes your files and <code>locate</code> uses that database to find your files. It does not actually do a real-time search, it simply looks up indexes in a database. That&#8217;s why this application is usually scheduled for a daily <code>updatedb</code>.</p><blockquote><p>The second command is called, well, <code>find</code>.</p></blockquote><p>This command performs a real-time search. It is more accurate than <code>locate</code>, but is obviously much slower. Let&#8217;s play with it a little:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al

csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name ThirdFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile
</pre><p>I printed the two <code>ls</code> commands so that you can see the directory structure. The third command is our <code>find</code>. It has a complex parameter system that I will not detail here, but the above example demonstrates the most common use of <code>find</code>. The first parameter, <code>.</code>, is the directory in which we want to search.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Tip:</strong> <code>.</code> refers to the current directory. <code>..</code> refers to the parent directory.</p></div><p>The second parameter we used for <code>find</code> was <code>-name</code>, followed by a file&#8217;s name. We can use <code>?</code> and <code>*</code> in the <code>-name</code> parameter to broaden our search:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name ?File
./SecondDir/aFile
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name *File
./SecondDir/aFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile</pre><p><code>?</code> stands for any single character, and <code>*</code> refers to any number of any characters.</p><p>Next, we will create a directory and make it unreadable by our user. We have not yet reviewed permissions, but don&#8217;t worry, we will shortly. For now, simply try the following:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ mkdir ThirdDir
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ chmod 000 ThirdDir
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name *File
./SecondDir/aFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile
find: `./ThirdDir': Permission denied
</pre><p>I wanted you to not have permission to a directory so that I can demonstrate what <code>find</code> outputs in this case. It tries to access all the directories and search for files that match the given pattern. When it can&#8217;t access a directory, it outputs a message. This is OK when you have one or two messages, but try to search for something starting from the root folder as an ordinary user. You will get hundreds of such error messages and probably only one or two search results. You don&#8217;t want to miss the results; you want to get rid of the error messages.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name *File 2&gt; /dev/null
./SecondDir/aFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile</pre><p>We redirected stderr into <code>/dev/null</code>. This points to&#8230; well nothing. Whatever you throw into <code>/dev/null</code> will simply vanish. It is common practice to send errors there when you don&#8217;t want to see them. If you prefer your results in a file, and your errors sent to <code>/dev/null</code>, you can use multiple redirections:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ find . -name *File 2&gt; /dev/null 1&gt;./SecondDir/ThirdFile
csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $</pre><p>As you can see, this command outputs nothing to the screen because both errors and standard output are sent to different files. But what if you want both in the same file? Well, you can send stderr into stdout and then send stdout to a file:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">find . -name *File 1&gt;./SecondDir/ThirdFile 2&gt;&amp;1</pre><p>Redirections are interpreted from right to left. So the first one that happens is <code>2>&amp;1</code>, which redirects standard error to standard output. Then <code>1>./SecondDir/ThirdFile</code> redirects standard output (with the errors already in it) into the specified file.</p><hr
/><h2>Let&#8217;s Talk About Permissions</h2><p>The permissions discussed in this tutorial are applicable to *nix operating systems. I am not that familiar with the latest Windows versions, but Microsoft uses a different concept for permissions on their file systems.</p><h3>Users and Groups</h3><p>There can be several users on the same computer. In fact, several applications register their own special user and use it to run the program in a restricted environment. Each user can be identified by their name and/or their ID, also known as UID.</p><blockquote><p>You can find the list of the currently existing users in the file <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Groups are listed in the file <code>/etc/group</code>. A group has a name and ID (known as GID), and a group is a container of zero or more users. Each user usually has at least one corresponding group, which has the same name as the user.</p><h3>The Owner</h3><p>Files have owners, and the user that creates a file is, by default, its owner. Directories are just special files, and they have the same owner and permission rules as ordinary files.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ls -al

/><h2>The Cat, Sed, and Pipe</h2><p>Here are a few of the most useful commands.</p><h3>Cat</h3><p>This command lets you read the contents of a file. Simply provide the filename as a parameter, and it outputs the file&#8217;s contents to stdout.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ cat ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
./SecondDir/aFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile
./SecondDir/ThirdFile
find: `./ThirdDir': Permission denied</pre><h3>Grep</h3><p>Grep searches for a pattern and outputs the matching lines. You can optionally specify a file to search as the third parameter:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ grep &quot;AnotherFile&quot; ./SecondDir/ThirdFile
./SecondDir/AnotherFile</pre><p>Adding the <code>--color</code> option highlights the matched word in the the resulting lines.</p><h3>Pipe</h3><p>The pipe is represented by the <code>|</code> character; it takes one command&#8217;s output and feeds it to a second command. This may sound simple, but it&#8217;s a huge thing. That single character has tens of thousands of lines of code behind it so that you can do this:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ cat ./SecondDir/ThirdFile | grep &quot;Another&quot;
./SecondDir/AnotherFile</pre><p>This actually runs the <code>cat</code> command, and instead of outputing the results to stdout, it feeds that output to <code>grep</code>. The <code>grep</code> command uses that data and searches for the string &#8220;Another&#8221;. The result is identical to our previous example.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong><a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0">The History of UNIX:</a></strong> This is an old video from AT&amp;T. It is a great video, but scroll to 4:56, if you are only interested in the PIPEs.</p></div><h3>Sed</h3><p>The <code>sed</code> command allows you to execute regular expressions on its input. It can read from a file or be used in a piped command. It outputs the result to stdout.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ cat ./SecondDir/ThirdFile | grep &quot;Another&quot; | sed -e &quot;s/AnotherFile/MyFile/&quot;
./SecondDir/MyFile</pre><p>This example adds a <code>sed</code> to our previous command. With the help of <code>sed</code>, we replaced the string &#8220;AnotherFile&#8221; with &#8220;MyFile&#8221; in the output of the <code>cat...grep</code>. Pretty cool, right?</p><p>The <code>sed</code> command can accept several parameters. Specifying the <code>-e</code> argument executes the regular expression on its input. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, check out these other Nettuts+ tutorials: <a

/><h2>Defining Your Own Commands</h2><p>Let&#8217;s imagine that you execute the following <code>ssh</code> connection command frequently:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ssh my_username@complicated.server.address.com -p 8743</pre><p>You can shorten this by creating a custom command, say <code>sshcon</code>. You could create your own commands by using an alias. Alias syntax is in the form of: <code>alias shorthand='original_command'</code>.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ alias sshcon='ssh my_username@complicated.server.address.com -p 8743'</pre><p>Running <code>sshcon</code> executes the more complicated <code>ssh</code> command. But aliases are temporary; they&#8217;re forgotten when you log out. One possible solution is to edit your <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p><h3>.bashrc and .bash.profile</h3><p>The <code>.bashrc</code> file is usually located in your home directory. This file lets you specify any command(s) you want to execute whenever you open a console or log into a shell. Let&#8217;s add the aforementioned <code>sshcon</code> alias to this file.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ mcedit ~/.bashrc</pre><p>Add your code to the end of the file, hit F2 to save the file, and then ESC twice to close the file. Press CTRL+D to log out from the shell. Open another shell and try your alias command. Voila.</p><p>Some operating systems, such as Solaris, may not have a <code>~/.bashrc</code> file. In this case, you can do your magic by editing <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. In fact, <code>~/.bash_profile</code> is always present on all systems.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>The Hidden Files:</strong> Files that begin with a dot (<code>.</code>) denote a hidden file.</p></div><hr
/><h2>A Little Networking</h2><p>Let&#8217;s play with the network a little.</p><h3>Ping</h3><p>The <code>ping</code> command is an easy way to check if a server is up and accessible.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=47 time=44.0 ms

csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ping inexistent.server
ping: unknown host inexistent.server
</pre><p>Its syntax is easy: <code>ping IP_address_or_name</code>. If the server is accessible, you will see a list of reply lines with details. If it&#8217;s not, an error message states the problem.</p><h3>Traceroute</h3><p>The <code>traceroute</code> command displays the route a packet takes from your computer to the destination device.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ traceroute 8.8.8.8

And despite their slight differences in syntax, their functionality is basically the same. This command allows us to see the current routing table of the system, and if necessary, add/delete static routes.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

The term &#8220;default&#8221; means anything not matched by something else or sent here. Loopback is our virtual local device, the one having the IP 127.0.0.1. This IP always refers to the local, machine and it is present on all operating systems ([ed] there&#8217;s no place like 127.0.0.1).</p><p>The second column is the gateway the connection uses to reach its destination. The first line displays my default gateway as 192.168.111.1. The second line for loopback goes to localhost, and the third line goes to <code>*</code>, no gateway is necessary for acessing our own network.</p><p>The third interesting thing here is the last column: &#8220;Iface&#8221;. It specifies the interface used to communicate to the specific destination. In our example, loopback communication goes over the loopback interface <code>lo</code>. Everything else goes through the <code>eno1</code> interface.</p><div
class="tip-shortcode"><p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you find no <code>route</code> command, try using <code>netstat -nr</code>. It should produce similar output.</p></div><h3>Network Configuration</h3><p>If you want a quick glance at your network configuration, just type <code>ifconfig</code> in the command line.</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ ifconfig

</pre><p>There is a lot of information here. First, we have two sections, each for a network adapter. My wired network card is called <code>eno1</code> on my system. You may see things like <code>e1000g0</code>, <code>eth0</code>, <code>en0</code> or other names. Wireless network devices usually (but not always) begin with a &#8220;w&#8221;.</p><p>On the same line is the current status of the interface. In this example, the interface is up, broadcasting, running, etc. The second line is for the IPv4 IP address, netmask and broadcast. The third line is very similar but for IPv6. The forth line, starting with &#8220;ether&#8221;, is the MAC address of the network card, and the remaining lines display data transfer statistics.</p><h3>Current Network Connections</h3><p>Another useful command is <code>netstat</code>. It can list all the network connections to the system, as well as the IPs, interfaces and ports the system listens on. Here is a part of <code>netstat</code>&#8216;s output on my system. I shortened it to eliminate irrelevant information:</p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">csaba@csaba-pc ~/tmp/NetTuts $ netstat -an

/><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>So there you have it: some of the most used CLI commands! Naturally, each of these commands are capable of much more than what I&#8217;ve covered in this tutorial. I hope I&#8217;ve shed a bit of light on some of these CLI mysteries. Thanks for reading!</p><div class="feedflare">
